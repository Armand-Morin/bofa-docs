## 1 Motivation for the project

Investors throughout the world are increasingly interested in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing.
The 2021 Global Sustainable Investment Reportindicated a significant increase for sustainable and responsible
investments, bringing the total to USD 35.3 trillion.
Many investors have social or ethical reasons for ESG investing, and academic and practitioner surveys indicate
that majority of surveyed investment professionals believe that incorporating ESG information into an investment
evaluation process is relevant to investment performance.

### 1.1 ESG-based portfolio construction

ESG identifies factors that reflect environmental considerations (E), societal preferences (S), and governance of the
firm (G) and may complement, or compete with, classical portfolio construction methods. It is complementary if
the ESG factors enhance alpha. It is competitive if the factors detract from alpha.

### 1.2 ESG ratings and scores

Billio et al. (“Inside the ESG Ratings: (Dis)agreement and Performance,” 2021): Analysis the ESG rating criteria
used by prominent agencies indicate a lack of a commonality in the definition of ESG (i) characteristics, (ii)
attributes and (iii) standards in defining E, S and G components. Such heterogeneity in rating criteria can lead
agencies to have opposite opinions on the same evaluated companies and that agreement across those providers was
found to be substantially low in many cases.

### 1.3 Climate-based investing

Climate risk is denitively back on the agenda of investors and goes beyond ESG ratings. However, climate risk
assessment methodologies have not reached maturity. Nevertheless, the development of climate risk measures and
their sophistication have an increasing impact on portfolio construction and management. While first developed on
the side of passive management and low-carbon equity indices, these approaches are now gaining a lot of traction
in active management.

### 1.4 Portfolio diversification and tail risk protection through ESG investing

Diversification is one of the most important concepts in the financial world. It is often said that diversification
is the only free lunch in finance. From a qualitative point of view, the concept of diversification is quite clear: a
portfolio is well-diversified if shocks in the individual components do not heavily impact on the overall portfolio.
Relatively simple to understand then but profoundly difficult to define. Indeed, there is no broadly accepted precise
and quantitative definition of diversification.
One of the most vexing problems in investment management is that diversification seems to disappear when
investors need it the most. A key challenge in the construction of diversified multi-asset portfolio strategies is that
even a seemingly well-balanced allocation to many asset classes can eventually translate into a portfolio with a very
concentrated set of underlying risk exposures.
Incorporating ESG into portfolios may also improve their diversification behavior.

### 1.5 Practical challenges with ESG investing

Practical challenges include

- inconsistent ESG metrics and ratings
- particularly noisy data
- entanglement of ESG factors with standard risk factors


The lack of standardized ESG metrics creates opportunities for greenwashing by companies less interested in pur-
suing legitimate ESG objectives, than in building brand by meeting minimum criteria for metrics that may be
somewhat easy to game.
ESG data typically are deficient in the following areas:

- Quantity: Not enough data are available.
- Consistency: Companies often report different ESG data items.
- Quality: Methodologies used to derive or compute the reported ESG data mayvary across companies.

Measurement: Monotonicity with Respect to the Sharpe Ratio and Multivariate Tests of Correlation.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
This paper reports an investigation into methods of portfolio performance measurement. The work is motivated
first by equivocal empirical evidence reported by several authors about the correlation of performance measures
with the Sharpe ratio. Secondly it is motivated by recent work which specifies that performance measures will
be monotone functions of the Sharpe ratio if portfolio returns follow the same location-scale distribution. The
paper demonstrates that the class of location-scale distributions is broader than previously reported. It presents
conditions under which monotonicity with respect to the Sharpe ratio will fail. The paper shows that for large
sample sizes the correlation between pairs of performance measures that are functions of the Sharpe ratio is
unity. The correct null hypothesis for tests of correlation is therefore rho=1. Two multivariate tests of this
null hypothesis are presented. The new tests are used to carry out of a comprehensive study of performance
measurement for a set over ninety UK investment trusts.

Cap Investor.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(4), pp. 31–44.
The rising popularity of socially responsible investing (SRI) has increased interest in the relationship between
traditional measures of corporate financial performance (CFP) and the emerging field of corporate social perfor-
mance (CSP). SRI investors have tended to have a large capitalization (cap) stock focus that has served them
well in the past, but that may be suboptimal in the future if we return to a period of small cap outperformance.
Using environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores as a proxy for CSP, our research supports past studies
showing a large cap bias in measures of CSP. Narrowing our focus, we find that within the US small cap stock
universe, the correlation between firm size and ESG scores is greatly reduced. We construct small cap ESG
leaders and laggards portfolios and test their performance. We demonstrate that performance was not affected
by neutralizing these portfolios with respect to firm size. Our results reinforce the idea that CSP proxies such
as ESG scores have the potential to practically enhance portfolio performance in US small cap stocks.
Alessandrini, F., Balula, D. B., and Jondeau, E. (2021).“ESG Screening in the Fixed-Income Universe.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
This paper evaluates the impact of a screening process based on Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG)
scores for an otherwise passive portfolio of investment-grade corporate bonds. The main result is that this filtering
leads to a substantial improvement of the targeted ESG score without reducing the risk-adjusted performance
but with significant biases in regional, sectoral, and risk factor exposures. We find that screening is very often
associated with a substantial improvement in the risk profile. In particular, ESG-tilted portfolios lead to large
negative exposure (i.e., protection) to credit risk. Screening based on the Environment score is where most of
the reduction in risk takes place, making this criterion particularly relevant in moving the portfolio toward a
more defensive composition. We demonstrate that screening at the regional and sectoral levels allows investors
to eliminate undesirable regional and sectoral exposures while delivering similar ESG scores and risk-adjusted
performances.
Alessandrini, F. and Jondeau, E. (2020).“ESG investing: from sin stocks to smart beta.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio
Management_ 46(3), pp. 75–94.
Research on socially responsible investment in equity markets initially focused on sin stocks. Since then, the
availability of data has been extended substantially and now covers environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) criteria. Using ESG scores of firms belonging to the MSCI World universe, the authors measure the
impact of score-based exclusion on both otherwise passive investment and smart beta strategies. They find that
exclusion leads to improved scores of initially standard portfolios without deterioration of the risk-adjusted
performance. Smart beta strategies exhibit a similar pattern, often in a more pronounced way. Moreover, the
results demonstrate that exclusion also implies regional and sectoral tilts as well as (possibly undesirable) risk
exposures of the portfolios.
Alessandrini, F. and Jondeau, E. (2021).“Optimal Strategies for ESG Portfolios.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio
Management_ 47(6), pp. 114–138.
Previous research has provided evidence that in the last decade, investing according to screening based on
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria would have allowed investors to considerably improve the
ESG quality of their portfolio without deterioration of its financial performance. However, a drawback of such a


screening process is that it may generate undesirable regional, sectoral, and risk factor exposures. In this article,
the authors propose an investment strategy that maximizes the ESG quality of the portfolio while maintaining
regional, sectoral, and risk factor exposures within stated limits. They provide evidence that such a portfolio
would have produced risk-adjusted performance at least as high as the standard MSCI benchmark for a wide
range of ESG criteria and regions over the 2007-2018 investment period.
Alford, A. W. (2019).“Some considerations for investors exploring ESG strategies.” In: _The Journal of Investing_
28(2), pp. 21–31.
Investors who are concerned about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors face numerous questions.
In the author opinion, investors need to determine which ESG issues are important for them, and how these
issues should be reflected in a portfolio. For some strategies, ESG factors are integral to the investment process,
whereas for other strategies, ESG factors are best captured via simple and transparent rules (screens and/or
tilts). Investors also face several practical implementation choices. Should each company be evaluated on the basis
of its current ESG profile, or is the trend more relevant? Should a company be analyzed on a stand-alone basis
or relative to its industry peers? And for the strategy, what is the appropriate level of active risk (tracking error)
relative to the policy benchmark? In addition, investors need to determine how to monitor any ESG strategy
over time, which will help ensure the strategy is performing as expected. In the author opinion, perhaps the
biggest challenge facing investors is articulating an investment thesis for an ESG strategy. Which ESG factors
are already reflected in security prices, and which ESG factors have the potential to drive outperformance?
Finally, the article identifies some differences between equity and fixed income strategies as they relate to ESG.
Amel-Zadeh, A. (2021).“The Materiality of Climate Risk.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Evidence from a global survey of nearly 700 investors and companies shows that investors consider climate risk
to be financially material and to represent regulatory and litigation risk, whereas far fewer companies believe
they are exposed to climate risks, diverge in their perspectives on the types of risks and consequently few make
any disclosures about it. Investors state difficulties with identifying and quantifying risks due to the lack of
disclosures as the main challenge in assessing the impact of climate change. The findings suggest that current
disclosure practices do not provide investors with adequate information about climate-related financial risks.
Amon, J., Rammerstorfer, M., and Weinmayer, K. (2021).“Passive ESG Portfolio Management – The Benchmark
Strategy for Socially Responsible Investors.” In: _Sustainability_ 13(16), p. 9388.
In this article, we investigate the notion of doing well while doing good from the perspective of passive portfolio
strategies. We analyze a number of asset allocation strategies based on ESG-weighting and compare their financial
and ESG performance for the US and Europe. We find no significant difference in the financial performance but
superior ESG performance of ESG-based strategies. It can be concluded that, compared to a naive strategy,
socially responsible investors are willing to pay a small premium for the impact of the portfolio via transaction
costs when rebalancing the portfolio according to their preferences for social responsibility. In addition, when
comparing the ESG-based strategies to a value-weighted strategy, we observe no significant difference in ESG
performance but a high degree of significance in the superior financial performance of the ESG-based strategy.
We also analyze the strategies with regards to the factor loadings given by the Fama-French five-factor model and
a sixth factor denoted GMB (Good minus Bad) and find significant differences across the regions and strategies.
Overall, the results show strong support of ESG-based strategies being preferred by socially responsible investors
but also suggest that such strategies might be preferred by conventional investors looking for a passively managed
alternative compared to a value-weighted index. Furthermore, it seems that such a strategy might be a more
adequate benchmark for active SRI funds.

tructure Investing.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(2), pp. 57–76.
In light of the increasingly severe consequences of climate change, an increasing number of institutional investors
want their investments to replicate their ethical values. This article identifies the decarbonization of global
power generation as an opportunity for those investors requiring sustainable impact while enhancing the risk-
adjusted returns for, and future-proofing of, their portfolios. After analyzing the worsening state of financial
markets, with high equity valuations and record-low bond yields, the authors demonstrate the added benefit of
economic resilience of sustainable infrastructure assets. A move into sustainable infrastructure is bolstered by
global political tailwinds earmarking fiscal stimulus to upgrade existing and new green infrastructure, as well as
regulators increasingly enforcing disclosure of progress. Finally, by delving deeper into portfolio construction, the
authors argue for the benefits of diversifying into the adjacent renewable-energy technologies needed to sustain
the forthcoming renewable-power networks to optimize the risk-return profile of portfolios.


Angelova, D., Bosello, F., Bigano, A., and Giove, S. (2021).“Sovereign rating methodologies, ESG and climate
change risk: an overview.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We review the sovereign credit rating methodologies of three credit rating agencies (Moody’s, S&P and Fitch)
and analyze how they currently accommodate climate change risk and ESG considerations. We elaborate on the
differences between the three rating methodologies and critically evaluate their suitability and limitations. We
propose lines of improvement with respect to the indicator selection, normalization, aggregation and weighting
procedures as well as the use of the sovereign rating indicator in connection with climate change scenarios.
Antoncic, M., Bekaert, G., Rothenberg, R. V., and Noguer, M. (2020).“Sustainable Investment - Exploring the
Linkage between Alpha, ESG, and SDG’s.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing has been one of the most important trends in the asset
management industry over the past decade. Previously institutional asset owners believed that ESG issues,
also known as nonfinancial risks and opportunities, were not relevant to portfolio value and therefore were
nonessential, or even in conflict with their fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of their beneficiaries. In
this paper, we analyze the relationship between alpha generation and ESG metrics. We also measure whether
companies have an either positive or negative net influence on the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s)
which are emerging as the new, broader standard to measure sustainability. First, we explore whether utilizing
ESG factors can improve performance vis a vis the MSCI US index. By constructing a sector-neutral portfolio
using MSCI ESG momentum scores from 2013 to 2018, we determine that it is feasible to generate positive
alpha from an ESG momentum strategy. Second, we utilize structured and unstructured data to determine a
company’s net influence on the SDGs, or what we call its SDG ’footprint.’ Our research shows that an ESG
momentum portfolio not only outperforms the MSCI US index but has a relatively better SDG footprint than
that of the index. Third, we establish a positive contemporaneous connection between the sample portfolio’s
ESG ratings change (its momentum) and its coinciding SDG footprint over the sample period. We conclude that
a positive linkage exists between ESG, alpha, and the SDG’s.

ment .” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(1), pp. 74–91.
The financial sector collectively cannot hedge all climate-related risks, and investors individually are unlikely
to affect climate developments significantly. However, the financial sector can help channel savings into green
projects and thus facilitate divestment from heavy-carbon-footprint producers. This article provides a novel
framework for understanding climate-related adaptation, mitigation, and transition risks and outlines a method
for valuing these risks in institutional investor portfolios. The authors’ proposed setup serves as a continuous call
to action to long-term institutional investors to obtain accurate information on climate-related risks and develop
appropriate frameworks for understanding these risks, regularly valuing them, and properly incorporating them
into their investment decisions.

market regimes: do different types of ethical screens matter?” In: _Financial Markets and Portfolio Management
volume_ 27 (397-429).
We investigate the performance of US mutual funds that employ different ethical criteria: religious, socially
responsible, and irresponsible. Performance is evaluated over different market regimes using a Markov-switching
conditional CAPM approach that endogenously defines different states of the market. This model is also extended
to a multifactor context. The results show that estimates of performance vary across different market regimes.
The Vice Fund, which invests in unethical firms, outperforms in low-volatility regimes, but underperforms in
high-volatility regimes. These results contradict the Vice Fund’s claim that it constitutes a ”solid investment
during recessionary periods”. Our results show that socially responsible and morally responsible funds exhibit
different performance across different market conditions, thereby supporting the use of performance evaluation
models that take into account different market regimes. Overall, different types of ethical screens seem to lead
to different performance patterns across different market regimes.
Arnott, R. D., Harvey, C. R., and Markowitz, H. (2019).“A backtesting protocol in the era of machine learning.”
In: _The Journal of Financial Data Science_ 1(1), pp. 64–74.
Machine learning offers a set of powerful tools that holds considerable promise for investment management. As
with most quantitative applications in finance, the danger of misapplying these techniques can lead to disap-
pointment. One crucial limitation involves data availability. Many of machine learning early successes originated
in the physical and biological sciences, in which truly vast amounts of data are available. Machine learning
applications often require far more data than are available in finance, which is of particular concern in longer-


horizon investing. Hence, choosing the right applications before applying the tools is important. In addition,
capital markets reflect the actions of people, which may be influenced by others actions and by the findings
of past research. In many ways, the challenges that affect machine learning are merely a continuation of the
long-standing issues researchers have always faced in quantitative finance. While investors need to be cautious,
more cautious than in past applications of quantitative methods new tools offer many potential applications in
finance. In this article, the authors develop a research protocol that pertains both to the application of machine
learning techniques and to quantitative finance in general.
Ascioglu, A., Gonzalez, J., and Zbib, L. (2022).“Analysis of Sustainability Reports for Top 20 Companies in the
S&P 500 Index.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(2).
An increasing number of companies are voluntarily issuing sustainability reports as investors are putting more
emphasis on the sustainability and the environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings of the companies
in their investment decisions. We analyze the sustainability reports from the top 20 companies in the S&P 500.
We find that these reports differ significantly based on their length and their word and number count. We also
apply Benford’s law to the numbers reported in sustainability reports. We examine the distributions of the first
and the second digits of the numbers and find that there is a rounding of numbers especially with the second
digit in the reports. We also find that the distributions of the first and second digits significantly deviate from
the expected distribution according to Benford’s law. Our results support the current push from regulators for
the standardization of sustainability reports to provide better ESG information to investors.

In this article, the authors evaluate a student-managed fund, Bryant University Archway Investment Fund (AIF),
from an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) perspective and develop a framework for integration of
ESG metrics for the fund. The authors explain why ESG issues are especially relevant to a student-managed
fund and describe efforts to move the AIF toward becoming ESG conscious. ESG integration begins with the
ESG assessment of the fund holdings followed by an analysis of each sector of the fund. They then offer several
ways to improve the ESG standing of each sector compared with various benchmarks.

Strategies: An Empirical Analysis of Portfolio Performances through the Booms and Busts in the European
Equity Market.” MA thesis. Copenhagen Business School.
This study investigates how portfolio construction- and investment principles, such as incorporation of ESG
information in decision making, can be applied to enhance stock portfolio performances in the European Equity
markets. The authors find that portfolios constructed with equal weights in combination with a buy and hold
strategy yield better result relative to a benchmark, while incorporation of ESG growth information further
enhances performances. On a more granular level, the authors confirm the notion that small-cap stock portfolios
outperform large-cap stock portfolios in periods of economic prosperity, while there is no evidence to suggest
the opposite during periods of economic hardship. The authors also find that the extension of the Fama-French
three-factor model with an ESG growth risk factor improves its ability to explain portfolio returns, especially
towards the end of the investment period. Evidence from conventional and extended models source more of the
experienced overperformance in small-cap portfolios to the size effect anomaly, while large-cap portfolio returns
are more prominently captured by the ESG growth risk factor.

In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This paper analyzes the asset pricing and portfolio implications of an important barrier to sustainable investing—
uncertainty about the corporate ESG profile. In equilibrium, the market premium increases and demand for
stocks declines under ESG uncertainty. In addition, the CAPM alpha and effective beta both rise with ESG
uncertainty and the negative ESG-alpha relation weakens. Employing the standard deviation of ESG ratings from
six major providers as a proxy for ESG uncertainty, we provide supporting evidence for the model predictions.
Our findings help reconcile the mixed evidence on the cross-sectional ESG-alpha relation and suggest that ESG
uncertainty affects the risk-return trade-off, social impact, and economic welfare.

This paper develops and applies an equilibrium model that accounts for ESG demand and supply dynamics. In
equilibrium, ESG preference shocks represent a novel risk source characterized by diminishing marginal utility
and positive premium. Expected green asset returns are negatively associated with time-varying convenience
yield, while exposures to ESG preference shocks lead to positive green premium. Augmenting these conflicting
forces with positive contemporaneous effects of preference shocks on realized returns, the green-minus-brown
portfolio delivers large positive payoffs for reasonably long horizons. Nonpecuniary benefits from ESG investing
account for a nontrivial and increasing fraction of total consumption.

Investing.” In: _The Journal of Wealth Management_ 19(4), pp. 14–23.
A review of academic literature suggests a lack of consensus on positive and negative abnormal returns associ-
ated with socially responsible investing/environmental, social, and governance (SRI/ESG) factors. This article
examines the benefit of incorporating ESG factors during a more recent period to acknowledge the ongoing
investment trend toward ESG. The authors find that the topquintile (most compliant) stocks ranked by ESG
score underperform the outsample research universe. They present evidence that indicates incorporating ESG
into a robust quantitative investment process can mitigate the adverse effect, however, thus providing investors
with a portfolio that outperforms a benchmark while allowing investors to embrace ESG.
Azevedo, V., Kaserer, C., and Campos, L. M. S. (2021).“Investor sentiment and the time-varying sustainability
premium.” In: _Journal of Asset Management_ 22, pp. 600–621.
Studies show the inconclusive results regarding the relation between corporate social and environmental re-
sponsibility (CSR and CER) and expected returns. We argue that the reason for these mixed results is that
the sustainability premium (i.e., the return difference of high-intensity minus low-intensity CSR/CER firms)
is time-varying and correlated with investor sentiment. We find that high-intensity CSR (CER) firms have a
monthly excess return that is 0.70 (0.88) p.p. higher following periods of low investor sentiment as compared to
periods of high sentiment. Given that standard pricing factors cannot fully explain the abnormal returns caused
by investor sentiment on the sustainability premium, we propose a sustainability pricing factor, estimated as
the second principal component of portfolios sorted based on environmental and social variables, which corrects
this mispricing.

model for evaluating the efficiency of socially responsible and conventional mutual funds.” In: _Journal of Risk_
19(1), pp. 77–90.
Although several data envelopment analysis (DEA) models have been proposed in the literature for mutual
funds’ performance evaluation, few of them incorporate nonfinancial criteria. In this paper a fuzzy DEA model
is used, allowing mutual funds relative performance evaluation in a more realistic and flexible way. We examine
the efficiency of forty US large cap equity mutual funds based not only on financial variables but also on
nonfinancial ones. To achieve this aim, we extend Basso and Funari’s mutual funds’ ethical level proposing a
more reliable fuzzy measure of the social environmental responsibility degree of equity mutual funds. It relies
on the corporate social performance of the companies invested in by the mutual funds and on the quality of
the management in terms of the transparency and credibility degree of the nonfinancial information provided
by the mutual funds. We can conclude that socially responsible mutual funds show better behavior in terms of
efficiency than conventional funds.
Bag, D. and Mohanty, S. (2021).“Impact of ESG Factors on Emerging Market Stock Returns.” In: _The Journal of
Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(2), pp. 138–147.
Empirical evidence indicates that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices are associated with a
company’s financial performance, but little has been mentioned about investors’ attention toward stock perfor-
mance. In this article, the authors conduct a test of the relationship between ESG performance disclosures and
a company’s financial or capital market performance. They choose a stratified sample of large-cap companies
across eight sectors drawn from the S&P 100 from 2016-2021. The changes in ESG ratings-namely, for gover-
nance and the environment-exhibit a small but significant impact on the stock’s performance. Their results show
that a few ESG disclosures are positively related and dominate over the usual company-level determinants of re-


turn on assets. They find corporate governance practices to be more significant than climate change disclosures.
These outcomes are robustly demonstrated on use cases of top stocks with investor safety recommendations.
The results could have useful implications for investors, fund managers, and regulators.

Journal of Portfolio Management_ 46(8), pp. 133–147.
Both large institutional and individual retail investors are increasingly demanding that the stewards of their
savings demonstrate consideration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) externalities in their decision
making. This study asks how different ESG scores are from traditional agency credit ratings. Are E, S, and G
scores correlated? Most importantly, can ESG scores enhance the investment process? Can an active, ESG-tilted
corporate bond portfolio strategy generate superior performance versus a relevant benchmark that does not
explicitly take ESG scores into account? The authors conclude that ESG scores can be used to enhance portfolio
outcomes via lower drawdowns, reduced portfolio volatility, and, in some cases, even marginally increased risk-
adjusted returns. Their backtesting suggests that E, S, and G scores are not related to one another and that
ESG scores are additive to traditional credit ratings; the contingent liabilities related to ESG issues are not
necessarily factored into rating agencies’ assigned credit ratings.
Bailey, D. H., Borwein, J. M., and Lopez de Prado, M. (2017).“Stock Portfolio Design and Backtest Overfitting.”
In: _Journal of Investment Management_ 15(1), pp. 75–87.
In mathematical finance, backtest overfitting connotes the usage of historical market data to develop an invest-
ment strategy, where too many variations of the strategy are tried, relative to the amount of data available.
Backtest overfitting is now thought to be a primary reason why investment models and strategies that look
good on paper often disappoint in practice. Models and strategies suffering from overfitting typically target the
specific idiosyncrasies of a limited dataset, rather than any general behavior, and, as a result, often perform
erratically when presented with new data. In this study, we address overfitting in the context of designing a
mutual fund or investment portfolio as a weighted collection of stocks. Very often a newly minted equity-based
fund of this type has been designed by an exhaustive computer-based search of some sort to obtain an optimal
weighting that exhibits excellent performance based, say, on the past 10 or 20 years’ historical market data, and
the fund often highlights this backtest performance.
Bajic, A., Kiesel, R., and Hellmich, M. (2021).“Handle with Care: Challenges and Opportunities of using Company-
Level Emissions Data for Assessing Financial Risks from Climate Change.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
By now climate change has a substantial impact on financial markets and risks related to it have to be analysed.
Besides the physical risk imposed by extreme weather conditions, companies face transition risks as economies
are rebuilding on a low-carbon basis. To assess the impact on individual companies reliable data are necessary.
Currently, by far most-used data relate to the carbon emissions of firms. By analysing a large data set on
company-level carbon emissions we identify several sources of data fault which have to be considered in any
data-intensive analysis. We show that year-by-year analysis of company emission consistency is best to find data
flaws. Also, we find that economic and carbon data are not perfectly synchronized. Our analysis indicates that
the widespread use of winsorizing is not enough to remove data flaws. Also, alternative emission measures do
not provide robustness of results as they tend to suffer from the same flaws. As providers update carbon data on
an ad-hoc basis, the previous analysis may not be repeated unless the data set on which it was based is saved.
Our findings serve as a warning for the reliability of (academic) analysis and highlight the possible impact of
bad data quality on algorithmic approaches to company-level emission data.

p. 1799.
This paper explores the potential diversification benefits of socially responsible investments for conventional stock
portfolios by examining the risk spillovers and dynamic correlations between conventional and sustainability
stock indexes from a number of regions. We observe significant unidirectional volatility transmissions from
conventional to sustainable equities, suggesting that the criteria applied for socially responsible investments
do not necessarily shield these securities from common market shocks. While significant dynamic correlations
are observed between sustainable and conventional stocks, particularly in Europe, the analysis of both in- and
out-of-sample dynamic portfolios suggests that supplementing conventional stock portfolios with sustainable
counterparts improves the risk/return profile of stock portfolios in all regions. The findings overall suggest that
sustainable investments can indeed provide diversification gains for conventional stock portfolios globally.


Ballinari, D. and Mahmoud, O. (2021).“From Chatter to Action: An Index of Sustainability Sentiment.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
Investments in sustainable assets have grown at a rapid pace over the last decade. Theory partially attributes
this increase to changes in investor taste for sustainability. We develop a novel and direct measure of market-wide
aggregate investor sentiment for sustainability and present evidence that it has a significant impact on asset
prices. Using microblogging data from a social media investing platform, we construct a daily index captur-
ing investor taste for environmental-, social-, and governance issues. We find that (i) sustainability sentiment
temporarily increases during market downturns; (ii) positive sentiment shocks drive prices of sustainable stocks
above their fundamental value, which is corrected in the long run, whereas negative shocks predict long-term
asset price decreases for sustainable stocks; and (iii) sentiment forecasts flows into sustainable mutual funds.
Barber, B. M., Morse, A., and Yasuda, A. (2021).“Impact investing.” In: _Journal of Financial Economics_ 139(1),
pp. 162–185.
We show that investors derive nonpecuniary utility from investing in dual-objective Venture Capital (VC) funds,
thus sacrificing returns. Impact funds earn 4.7 percentage points (ppts) lower internal rates of return (IRRs)
ex-post than traditional VC funds. In random utility/willingness-to-pay (WTP) models investors accept 2.5-3.7
ppts lower IRRs ex ante for impact funds. The positive WTP result is robust to fund access rationing and
investor heterogeneity in fund expected returns. Development organizations, foundations, financial institutions,
public pensions, Europeans, and United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment signatories have high
WTP. Investors with mission objectives and/or facing political pressure exhibit high WTP; those subject to
legal restrictions (e.g., Employee Retirement Income Security Act) exhibit low WTP.

Geophysicists examine and document the repercussions for the earth climate induced by alternative emission
scenarios and model specifications. Using simplified approximations, they produce tractable characterizations of
the associated uncertainty. Meanwhile, economists write highly stylized damage functions to speculate about how
climate change alters macroeconomic and growth opportunities. How can we assess both climate and emissions
impacts, as well as uncertainty in the broadest sense, in social decision-making? We provide a framework for
answering this question by embracing recent decision theory and tools from asset pricing, and we apply this
structure with its interacting components to a revealing quantitative illustration.

The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have created societal and political pressure for
pension funds to address sustainable investing. We run two field surveys (n = 1,669, n = 3,186) with a pension
fund that grants its members a real vote on its sustainable-investment policy. Two-thirds of participants are
willing to expand the fund’s engagement with companies based on selected SDGs, even when they expect
engagement to hurt financial performance. Support remains strong after the fund implements the choice. A key
reason is participants’ strong social preferences.
Bax, K., Sahin, O., Czado, C., and Paterlini, S. (2021).“ESG, Risk, and (tail) dependence.” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
While environmental, social, and governance (ESG) trading activity has been a distinctive feature of financial
markets, the debate if ESG scores can also convey information regarding a company’s riskiness remains open.
Regulatory authorities, such as the European Banking Authority (EBA), have acknowledged that ESG factors
can contribute to risk. Therefore, it is important to model such risks and quantify what part of a company’s
riskiness can be attributed to the ESG ratings. This paper aims to question whether ESG scores can be used to
provide information on (tail) riskiness. By analyzing the (tail) dependence structure of companies with a range
of ESG scores, using high-dimensional vine copula modelling, we are able to show that risk can also depend on
and be directly associated with a specific ESG rating class. Empirical findings on real-world data show positive
not negligible dependencies between clusters determined by ESG scores, especially during the 2008 crisis.
Baz, S., Cathcart, L., Michaelides, A., and Zhang, Y. (2021).“Climate Regulatory Exposure: Evidence from Stock
Returns.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We propose a new measure of firm-level climate regulatory exposure based on 10-K filings. Using the 2016
Trump election as an exogenous shock to perceived climate regulatory risks, we identify a positive effect on
stock returns for firms with higher climate regulatory exposures; they experience 240 to 270 basis points higher
cumulative returns post-election. For firms with higher climate regulatory exposure, investor attention falls and
carbon emissions rise in the year following the election, consistent with the hypothesis that investors become


less concerned with climate regulatory risks after the election. Results are robust to trade, tax and oil price
exposures.

This paper analyses the effect of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on mutual funds and
individual investors in the EU. First, we study whether affected funds increase their sustainability compared to
a control group. Second, we examine if the regulation makes individual investors allocate more capital into more
sustainable funds. In a difference-in-differences setting, we analyse the influence of the regulation on ESG fund
scores and fund net inflows. Our results show that affected funds increase their sustainability rating after the
policy intervention. Additionally, we find that a better ESG label leads to larger fund net inflows.

Capturing Corporates’ Sustainability-Related Activities with Job Postings.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG
Investing_ 1(2), pp. 16–25.
The emergence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing resulted in a flurry of studies examining
the effects of incorporating ESG considerations on portfolio performance. Limited attention, however, was given
to analyzing corporate activities related to ESG and sustainability. The authors employ a novel dataset of over
200 million job postings by US firms since 2014 and use natural language processing to identify ESG-related
openings and assess companies’ planned ESG activities. Using the job postings data allows one to learn about
and monitor planned sustainability-related corporate activities based on firms’ actions, rather than relying solely
on their announcements (i.e., what firms do as opposed to what firms say they do). The authors find that ESG
job posting data can serve as a leading indicator of future changes in firms’ ESG ratings. Firms with higher
abnormal ESG hiring posting intensity were more likely to experience subsequent rating improvements and
enjoyed better stock performance 2-3 years following the posting date.

It’s Time to Cross the Rubicon.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
his research is the companion study of three previous research projects conducted at Amundi that address the
issue of ESG (Berg et al., 2014; Bennani et al., 2018; Drei et al., 2019). These studies, which were focused on
the stock market, showed that 2014 marks a turning point for ESG screening and the performance of active
and passive management in developed equities. Indeed, ESG investing tended to penalize both passive and
active investors between 2010 and 2013. Contrastingly, ESG investing has been a source of outperformance
since 2014 in Europe and North America. Moreover, it appears that ESG investing and factor investing are
increasingly connected. In particular, Bennani et al. (2018) and Drei et al. (2019) concluded that ESG is a new
risk factor in the Eurozone. The case of fixed income is particular since it has been little studied by academics
and professionals. It is true that implementing an ESG investment policy in the bond market is less obvious
than in the stock market. For example, in the case of sovereign bonds using ESG filters may dramatically change
the profile of the bond portfolio, particularly in terms of liquidity. In fact, it seems that ESG investors pursue
two different goals when they consider equities and bonds. They invest in stocks with good ESG ratings in
order to avoid extra-financial longterm risks, whereas they consider that fixed income is the field of impact
investing. This explains the high demand for green and social bonds, and this also explains why ESG screening
is less widely implemented in fixed income markets than in equity markets. The objective of this new study is
to explore the impact of ESG investing on asset pricing in the corporate bond market. For that, we apply the
methodologies that have been used by Bennani et al. (2018) for testing ESG screening in active and passive
management. In particular, we consider the sorted portfolio approach of Fama and French (1992), and the index
optimization method that consists in minimizing the active risk with respect to the benchmark while controlling
for the ESG excess score. Three investment universes are analyzed: euro-denominated investment grade bonds,
dollar-denominated investment grade bonds, and high-yield bonds. Results differ from one universe to another.
In the case of EUR IG bonds, we retrieve some common patterns observed by Bennani et al. (2018) in the case
of equities. Indeed, from 2010 to 2013, ESG screening has produced a negative alpha, whereas we observe an
outperformance since 2014 when we implement ESG scoring in active and passive management. In the case of
USD IG bonds, the results are disappointing since ESG screening produces negative alpha for the entire period.
Results on high-yield bonds are difficult to interpret since ESG coverage of this market is not satisfactory. We
also test how ESG has impacted the cost of corporate debt. Our results show that there is a positive correlation
between ESG and credit ratings. This is normal since credit rating agencies also incorporate extra-financial risks
in their default risk models. Using the approach developed by Crifo et al. (2017), we propose an integrated


credit-ESG model in order to understand the marginal effects of ESG on the cost of capital. We find that there
is a negative relationship between ESG scores and yield spreads. The better the ESG rating, the lower the
yield spread. For instance, we estimate that the cost of capital difference is equal to 31 bps between a worst-
in-class corporate and a best-in-class corporate in the case of EUR IG corporate bonds. In the case of USD IG
corporate bonds, the difference is lower but remains significant at 15 bps. Moreover, the impact of ESG is more
pronounced for some sectors, for instance Banking and Utility and Energy. These results are important because
ESG investing and ESG financing are two sides of the same coin. In order to tackle environmental and social
issues, ESG must be a winning bet for both investors and issuers.

Journal of Portfolio Management_ 46(3), pp. 108–122.
In recent years, interest has heightened in ESG, particularly regarding the integration of climate risk metrics
such as carbon intensity in institutional portfolios. This article focuses on low volatility equity strategies, which
are a natural candidate for examining the impact of incorporating climate risk as both forms of investing focus
on risk. The authors find that meaningful levels of carbon reduction can be achieved across a range of low-
volatility-type portfolios without compromising the volatility reduction objectives of the portfolio. There is also
a point at which further reducing carbon has an increasingly negative impact on volatility reduction. Based on
the authors historical simulations, between 30% and 70% is the range in which this tipping point occurs.

Portfolios.” In: _The Journal of Index Investing_ 8(3), pp. 89–101.
Many investors are starting to explore ways to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) consider-
ations into their portfolios. Factor portfolios and indexes that integrate ESG allow investors to capture both the
long-term durable factor premiums while allowing them to invest in companies with attractive ESG attributes.
Traditional factors and ESG both have strong investment rationale for investors with long horizons, but how
should blended ESG-factor portfolios be constructed? This article discusses several ways to integrate ESG into
factor portfolios. The authors show that the approach chosen depends on the investor’s investment rationale
behind integrating ESG, desired exposure, performance expectations, and preference for conceptual consistency.

optimal portfolio construction ahead of the transition to a lower-carbon economy.” In: _Annals of Operations
Research_ 299(1-2), pp. 847–871.
There is an increasing likelihood that governments of major economies will act within the next decade to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, probably by intervening in the fossil fuel markets through taxation or cap & trade
mechanisms (collectively ”carbon pricing”). We develop a model to capture the potential impact of carbon pricing
on fossil fuel stocks, and use it to inform Bayesian portfolio construction methodologies, which are then used to
create what we call Smart Carbon Portfolios. We find that investors could reduce ex-post risk by lowering the
weightings of some fossil fuel stocks with corresponding higher weightings in lower-risk fossil fuel stocks and/or
in the stocks of companies active in energy efficiency markets. The financial costs of such de-risking strategy are
found to be statistically negligible in risk-return space. Robustness of the results is explored with alternative
approaches.
Bengo, I., Borrello, A., and Chiodo, V. (2021).“Preserving the Integrity of Social Impact Investing: Towards a
Distinctive Implementation Strategy.” In: _Sustainability_ 13(5), p. 2852.
Social impact investing (SII) is a strategy of asset allocation that aims to generate social and environmental
impact alongside a financial return. Compared to other approaches of sustainable finance it holds an enormous
potential of generating solutions to societal challenges. However, scholars have claimed that social impact of-
ten just employs logic upheld by the mainstream investment approach. Therefore, the paper investigates the
assumption that SII has not developed a distinctive implementation strategy able to translate the prioritization
of social impact into practice and how to overcome this issue. The thematic analysis of data collected through
105 interviews with Italian SII financiers and the top managers of social ventures allowed us to identify three
features of an SII tailored practice: promoting a cultural shift of intermediaries, adopting a coopetition approach,
and integrating the social impact in the terms of the financial transaction. Lastly, the paper drafts a research
agenda to enhance the proper theorization of SII focusing on the definition of social risk, social return, and
governance mechanisms. The key contribution of this article is confirming the lack of an SII-specific practice
able to endogenize the intent of prioritizing social impact and providing suggestions to prevent the risk of impact
washing.

investing has impacted the asset pricing in the equity market.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
ESG investing has gained considerable traction over the past few years and, alongside smart beta, factor investing
and alternative risk premia, is one of the current hot topics for the asset management industry. Nevertheless, even
though large institutions such as insurance companies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds have invested
significantly in ESG strategies over recent years and we are observing a substantial and increasing interest from
other investors such as wealth management or retail investors, the question of performance remains a controversial
issue and a puzzle for the financial community. Indeed, academic findings have been mixed and have revealed a
U-shape pricing of stocks in the equity market, meaning that both best-in-class and worst-in-class ESG stocks
have been rewarded by the equity market in the past.In this research, we analyze the relationship between ESG
and performance in the recent years (2010 - 2017) since ESG was more an anecdotal and explanatory investment
idea before the Global Financial Crisis. For that, we consider different regions (North America, Europe, Japan,
World) and different investment styles (passive management, active management and factor investing). We show
that ESG investing has been rewarded since 2014, but not before. Across the three ESG pillars, the Environment
factor in North America and the Governance factor in the Eurozone performed the strongest. Overall, the study
reveals that ESG does not impact all stocks, but tends to impact best-in-class and worst-in-class assets.Contrary
to common beliefs, we also observe that ESG had little impact on volatility and drawdown management during
the 2010-2017 period. In the case of passive management, implementing an ESG strategy helps to improve the
information ratio if the investor accepts to take a tracking error risk. Finally, we show that ESG investing is
related to factor investing. In particular, we conclude that ESG investing remains an alpha strategy in North
America, whereas it has become a beta strategy in the Eurozone.

In: _SSRN e-Print_.
The explosion in ESG research has led to a strong reliance on ESG rating providers. We document widespread
changes to the historical ratings of a key rating provider, Refinitiv ESG (formerly ASSET4). Depending on
whether the original or rewritten data are used, ESG-based classifications of firms into ESG quantiles and tests
that relate ESG scores to returns change. While there is a positive link between ESG scores and firms’ stock
market performance in the rewritten data, we fail to observe such a relationship in the initial data. The ESG
data rewriting is an ongoing rather than a one-off phenomenon.

Problem of Noise.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
How strongly does ESG (environmental, social and governance) performance affect stock returns? Answering
this question is difficult because existing measures of performance, ESG ratings, are noisy. To tackle the bias,
we propose a noise correction procedure, in which we instrument ESG ratings with ratings of other ESG rating
agencies, as in the classical errors-in-variables problem. The corrected estimates demonstrate that the effect of
ESG performance on stock returns is stronger than previously estimated; the standard regression estimates of
ESG ratings’ impact on stock returns are biased downward by about 60%. Our dataset includes scores of eight
ESG rating agencies for firms located in North America, Europe, and Japan. We determine which agencies’
scores are valid instruments (not all of them are) and estimate the noise-to-signal ratio for each ESG rating
agency (some of which are very large). Overall, our results suggest that it is advantageous to rely on several
complementary ratings. In our sample, stocks with higher ESG performance have higher expected returns. Our
model provides several explanations for this finding.

Berg, F., Kolbel, J. F., and Rigobon, R. (2022b).“Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings.” In:
_Review of Finance_.
This paper investigates the divergence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings based on data
from six prominent ESG rating agencies: Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD), Sustainalytics, Moody’s ESG
(Vigeo-Eiris), S&P Global (RobecoSAM), Refinitiv (Asset4), and MSCI. We document the rating divergence and
map the different methodologies onto a common taxonomy of categories. Using this taxonomy, we decompose
the divergence into contributions of scope, measurement, and weight. Measurement contributes 56% of the
divergence, scope 38%, and weight 6%. Further analyzing the reasons for measurement divergence, we detect a
rater effect where a rater’s overall view of a firm influences the measurement of specific categories. The results
call for greater attention to how the data underlying ESG ratings are generated.
Berk, J. B. and van Binsbergen, J. H. (2021).“The Impact of Impact Investing.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We evaluate the quantitative impact of ESG divestitures. For divestitures to have impact they must change
the cost of capital of affected firms. We derive a simple expression for the change in the cost of capital as a
function of three inputs: (1) the fraction of socially conscious capital, (2) the fraction of targeted firms in the
economy and (3) the correlation between the targeted firms and the rest of the stock market. Given the current
state of ESG investment we find that the impact on the cost of capital is too small to meaningfully affect real
investment decisions. We empirically corroborate these small estimates by studying firm changes in ESG status.
When firms are either included or excluded from the leading socially conscious US index (FTSE USA 4Good)
we find no detectable effect on the cost of capital. We conclude that current ESG divesture strategies have had
little impact and will likely have little impact in the future. Our results suggest that to have impact, instead
of divesting, socially conscious investors should invest and exercise their rights of control to change corporate
policy.

evaluation of Black Litterman, mean-variance, and naive diversification approaches.” In: _The European Journal
of Finance_ 23(1), pp. 1–30.
The Black Litterman model aims to enhance asset allocation decisions by overcoming the problems of mean-
variance portfolio optimization. We propose a sample-based version of the Black Litterman model and implement
it on a multi-asset portfolio consisting of global stocks, bonds, and commodity indices, covering the period from
January 1993 to December 2011. We test its out-of-sample performance relative to other asset allocation models
and find that Black Litterman optimized portfolios significantly outperform na ive-diversified portfolios (1/N
rule and strategic weights), and consistently perform better than mean-variance, Bayes Stein, and minimum-
variance strategies in terms of out-of-sample Sharpe ratios, even after controlling for different levels of risk
aversion, investment constraints, and transaction costs. The BL model generates portfolios with lower risk, less
extreme asset allocations, and higher diversification across asset classes. Sensitivity analyses indicate that these
advantages are due to more stable mixed return estimates that incorporate the reliability of return predictions,
smaller estimation errors, and lower turnover.
Bessler, W. and Wolff, D. (2017).“Portfolio Optimization with Industry Return Prediction Models.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
We postulate that utilizing return prediction models with fundamental, macroeconomic, and technical indica-
tors instead of using historical averages should result in superior asset allocation decisions. We investigate the
predictive power of individual variables for forecasting industry returns in-sample and out-of-sample and then
analyze multivariate predictive regression models including OLS, a regularization technique, principal compo-
nents, a target-relevant latent factor approach, and forecast combinations. The gains from using industry return
predictions are evaluated in an out-of-sample Black-Litterman portfolio optimization framework. We provide em-
pirical evidence that portfolio optimization utilizing industry return prediction models significantly outperform
portfolios using historical averages and those being passively managed.
Bettin, G. (2021).“Sustainable finance and ESG scores: A portfolio analysis a la Fama and French.” MA thesis.
Universita Ca Foscari Venezia.
In recent years, people around the world have expressed their concerns regarding the environment and society
and the concept of sustainable development has expanded considerably. One way to contribute to sustainable
development is to encourage individuals and institutional investors to make investment choices aimed at reward-
ing companies engaged in the management of environmental and social impact and committed to improving


their corporate governance. For this reason, sustainable finance has born. The prevailing approach to Sustain-
able and Responsible Investing (SRI) is the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors
into financial analysis, which can improve the risk-return profile of investments. This master thesis is a further
contribution to the existing studies on the performance of ESG portfolios. First, companies included in the S&P
100 were ranked based on their ESG scores, which were provided by Refinitiv, one of the largest providers of
financial data. The next step was the creation of ”bottom” portfolios, consisting of the 20 low-ranked stocks
and ”top” portfolios, composed by the 20 high-ranked stocks. Then, long-short portfolios were constructed, by
holding a long position in high-rated portfolios and a short position in low-rated portfolios. The analysis was
carried out using the multi-factor models of Fama and French and discusses the possible significant differences in
the performance and risk exposure between low-rated and high-rated portfolios. Thanks to this research, it has
been possible to identify which portfolios perform best in the timeframe July 2003-June 2020, offering a brief
insight into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial performance of sustainable and responsible
investments too.
Billio, M., Costola, M., Hristova, I., Latino, C., and Pelizzon, L. (2021).“Inside the ESG Ratings: (Dis)agreement
and Performance.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We analyze the ESG rating criteria used by prominent agencies and show that there is a lack of a commonality
in the definition of ESG (i) characteristics, (ii) attributes and (iii) standards in defining E, S and G components.
We provide evidence that heterogeneity in rating criteria can lead agencies to have opposite opinions on the same
evaluated companies and that agreement across those providers is substantially low. Those alternative definitions
of ESG also affect sustainable investments leading to the identification of different investment universes and
consequently to the creation of different benchmarks. This implies that in the asset management industry it is
extremely difficult to measure the ability of a fund manager if financial performances are strongly conditioned
by the chosen ESG benchmark. Finally, we find that the disagreement in the scores provided by the rating
agencies disperses the effect of preferences of ESG investors on asset prices, to the point that even when there
is agreement, it has no impact on financial performances.
Bingler, J. A., Kraus, M., and Leippold, M. (2021).“Cheap Talk and Cherry-Picking: What ClimateBert has to
say on Corporate Climate Risk Disclosures.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Disclosure of climate-related financial risks greatly helps investors assess companies’ preparedness for climate
change. Voluntary disclosures such as those based on the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are being hailed as an effective measure for better climate risk management. We
ask whether this expectation is justified. We do so with the help of a deep neural language model, which we
christen ClimateBert. We train ClimateBert on thousands of sentences related to climate-risk disclosures aligned
with the TCFD recommendations. In analyzing the disclosures of TCFD-supporting firms, ClimateBert comes
to the sobering conclusion that the firms’ TCFD support is mostly cheap talk and that firms cherry-pick to
report primarily non-material climate risk information. From our analysis, we conclude that the only way out
of this dilemma is to turn voluntary reporting into regulatory disclosures.

ments: The Role of Active Institutional Ownership, Signaling, Materiality, and Sentiment.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Corporate climate disclosures based on the TCFD recommendations are considered an important prerequisite
to managing climate-related financial risks. At the same time, current disclosures are imprecise, inaccurate, and
greenwashing-prone. Yet, existing research on this matter suffers from small samples or inaccuracies. Therefore,
we introduce a scalable deep learning approach to enable comprehensive climate disclosure analyses of large
samples by fine-tuning the ClimateBert model. Our model significantly outperforms previous approaches. We
then extract the amount of cheap talk, defined as the share of precise versus imprecise climate commitments, of
14,584 annual reports of the MSCI World index firms from 2010 to 2020. Finally, we use this data to test various
hypotheses on the drivers of cheap talk. We find that institutional ownership, targeted institutional investor
engagement, materiality and downside risk disclosures are associated with less cheap talk. Signaling by publicly
supporting the TCFD is associated with more cheap talk.
Bjerring, T., Ross, O., and Weissensteiner, A. (2017).“Feature selection for portfolio optimization.” In: _Annals of
Operations Research_ 256, pp. 21–40.
Most portfolio selection rules based on the sample mean and covariance matrix perform poorly out-of-sample.
Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence that such optimization rules are not able to beat simple rules
of thumb, such as 1/N. Parameter uncertainty has been identified as one major reason for these findings. A
strand of literature addresses this problem by improving the parameter estimation and/or by relying on more


robust portfolio selection methods. Independent of the chosen portfolio selection rule, we propose using feature
selection first in order to reduce the asset menu. While most of the diversification benefits are preserved, the
parameter estimation problem is alleviated. We conduct out-of-sample back-tests to show that in most cases
different well-established portfolio selection rules applied on the reduced asset universe are able to improve alpha
relative to different prominent factor models.

25(2), pp. 103–112.
This article examines the journey from value-based or ethical investing programs to more mainstream approaches
integrating socially responsible corporate behaviors into investment processes. This trend has led to a differenti-
ation between negative screening and best-practice ratings for environmental, social, and corporate governance
(ESG) performance. The authors detail the methodology behind the Thomson Reuters corporate responsibility
ratings, which provide objective and comparable quantifications of ESG performance for some 5,000 companies.
They also provide a context for the usefulness of the ratings and the associated benchmarks in research and
investing, for both current and future directions.
Blitz, D. and Hoogteijling, T. (2021).“Carbon-Tax-Adjusted Value.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We examine the effects of incorporating a potential tax on carbon emissions into a value investment strategy.
We show that in a portfolio optimization problem, a carbon tax at the stock level is mathematically equivalent
to a carbon constraint at the portfolio level. Using this insight we derive a value-carbon efficient frontier that
reflects the trade-off between a high value exposure and a low carbon footprint. Empirically we find that carbon
taxes up to $100, corresponding to a portfolio carbon footprint reduction of about 50%, have little effect on
the characteristics and the performance of the long side of a value strategy. Much more aggressive footprint
reduction levels seem unreasonable, as they correspond to extremely high carbon tax levels and performance
starts to decay.
Bohn, J., Goldberg, L. R., and Ulucam, S. (2022).“Sustainable Investing From a Practitioner’s Viewpoint: What’s
in Your ESG Portfolio?” In: _Journal of Investment Management_ 20(2).
Many investors have shifted their asset allocations to account for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
issues. While we welcome this shift from an ethical perspective, the financial and non-financial benefits of ESG
investing as well as best practices for portfolio construction are subjects of heated debate. We look at aspects
of the debate through a series of practical examples. First, we illustrate the trade-off between risk control and
unwanted exposures in energy and ”vice” stock exclusions, which have exhibited inconsistent performance at a
ten-year horizon. Next, we show how recent underperformance of a gender lens portfolio has been confounded
by technology stocks. Finally, we explore how ESG score disparities lead to important differences in portfolios
constructed with these scores. In aggregate, our examples point to the inherent complexity of ESG investing,
which will benefit from better data, transparency, customization, and an acknowledgement that doing good does
not necessarily lead to doing well. An important theme throughout this paper is that everything should be made
as simple as possible, but no simpler.
Bolliger, G. and Cornilly, D. (2021).“Sustainability Attribution: The Case of Carbon Intensity.” In: _The Journal
of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(1), pp. 93–99.
This article proposes a method to decompose the carbon intensity of a portfolio with respect to a benchmark into
an allocation and a selection component. The carbon-intensity decomposition allows for a better understanding
of the sources of the difference between the carbon footprint of a portfolio and that of its benchmark. As
such, it prevents greenwashing by analyzing whether the carbon exposure of a portfolio results from active
stock selection choices on the part of the manager or from passive sector exclusion decisions. The authors’
approach is based on methods developed for traditional performance attribution. They discuss an equity example
using the MSCI ACWI Sustainable Impact Index and a fixed-income example around the ICE BofA Global
Corporate Green Bond Index. In the latter example, they show that a higher portfolio carbon intensity does not
necessarily contradict the portfolio’s stated environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or impact objectives.
Their methodology can easily be extended to any other sustainability or impact metric that is constructed as a
weighted average of asset scores, thus providing greater precision in analyzing the sources and implications of
incorporating ESG into portfolio construction.
Bolton, P. and Kacperczyk, M. (2021).“Do investors care about carbon risk?” In: _Journal of Financial Economics_
142(2), pp. 517–549.
We study whether carbon emissions affect the cross-section of US stock returns. We find that stocks of firms
with higher total carbon dioxide emissions (and changes in emissions) earn higher returns, controlling for size,


book-to-market, and other return predictors. We cannot explain this carbon premium through differences in
unexpected profitability or other known risk factors. We also find that institutional investors implement ex-
clusionary screening based on direct emission intensity (the ratio of total emissions to sales) in a few salient
industries. Overall, our results are consistent with an interpretation that investors are already demanding com-
pensation for their exposure to carbon emission risk.
Bonaparte, Y. (2021).“The ESG Investor Sentiment Index: A Cross Sectional and Time Series Analyses.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
We constructed an ESG investors’ sentiment Index (ESG-ISX) that reflects four key components: (1) governance:
gap between women and men in labor participation and pay; (2) sustainability: renewable energy production;
(3) environment: global warming index; and (4) ESG google search sentiment. Applying the ESG-ISX monthly
index data between 1/2004 and 7/2021, we find it is increasing with a convex fashion, and comoves with key
financial indicators, such as, companies’ cost of capital. The raise of ESG investors’ sentiment has implication
at the household and stock market levels. At the household level, it increases the stock market participation;
causes households to allocate more in risky assets, and mitigate this additional risk by increasing the number of
stocks in their portfolio, hence, more diversification. At the stock market level, we show that the overall impact
in equity prices is diminishing in recent years, and the raise of ESG-ISX increases the consensus and agreement
among investors, as such, we suggest it has implication on the stock market volatility.

About the ESG Performance of Companies.” In: _Data Science for Economics and Finance_. Springer International

We present a general monitoring methodology to summarize news about predefined entities and topics into
tractable time-varying indices. The approach embeds text mining techniques to transform news data into nu-
merical data, which entails the querying and selection of relevant news articles and the construction of frequency-
and sentiment-based indicators. Word embeddings are used to achieve maximally informative news selection and
scoring. We apply the methodology from the viewpoint of a sustainable asset manager wanting to actively follow
news covering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects. In an empirical analysis, using a Dutch-
written news corpus, we create news-based ESG signals for a large list of companies and compare these to
scores from an external data provider. We find preliminary evidence of abnormal news dynamics leading up to
downward score adjustments and of efficient portfolio screening.
Boucher, C., Le Lann, W., Matton, S., and Tokpavis, S. (2021). _Backtesting ESG Ratings_. Tech. rep. University of
Orleans.
Sustainable investing is growing fast and investors are increasingly integrating environmental, social and gover-
nance (ESG) criteria. However, ESG ratings are derived using heterogeneous data and non-standardised method-
ologies and so are quite divergent across providers, and this suggests that a formal statistical procedure is needed
to evaluate the accuracy of any given ESG rating system. This paper develops a backtesting procedure that
evaluates how well these extra-financial metrics help in predicting whether ESG risks will materialise, as given
by increased idiosyncratic volatility. Technically, the inference is based on extending the conditional predictive
ability test of Giacomini and White (2006) to a panel data setting. We apply our methodology to two ESG rat-
ing systems from Sustainalytics and Asset4 for Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. The results
show that the null hypothesis of lacking informational content of ESG ratings is rejected in Europe and North
America, where there is less disagreement between the two ratings, while the results are mixed for the Asia-
Pacific region, where there is more disagreement. Furthermore, applying the test only to firms with convergent
ESG ratings leads to the null hypothesis being rejected for all three regions. Beyond providing insights into the
accuracy of each of the ESG rating systems, these results suggest that information gathered from several ESG
rating providers should be cross-checked before ESG is integrated into investment processes.

In this article, the authors explore six quantitative environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) strategies
to provide insights into best practices for ESG portfolio construction. These strategies offer different approaches
to the trade-off between desired ESG attributes and investment performance. They conclude that fully under-
standing the dynamics of these trade-offs will allow investors to select the strategy that best matches their
ethical and financial views.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information demands attention within the asset management
industry since it has become widely accepted that making an allowance for ESG criteria within an equity
portfolio enhances returns. The authors test this proposition by incorporating ESG criteria into a worldwide
market neutral portfolio using an ”off-the-shelf” third-party database of individual security ratings. Our results
show that incorporating ESG information into a worldwide equity-market-neutral portfolio yields no additional
return because any benefits from tilting toward a better-rated ESG portfolio is already wholly captured by other
well-known equity factors. Doing so, however, does not hurt returns. They conclude that ESG should not be
considered as a unique equity factor.
Briere, M., Peillex, J., and Ureche, L. (2017).“Do Social Responsibility Screens Really Matter When Assessing
Mutual Fund Performance?” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This paper questions the contribution that socially responsible (SR) screening makes to mutual fund perfor-
mance. We propose a new decomposition of the variability of SR mutual fund returns making it possible to
isolate the contribution of SR screening and compare it with the other traditional sources of performance: mar-
ket movements, asset allocation choices and active management. Our results, based on a sample of SR equity
mutual funds show that SR screening does contribute to the variability of mutual fund performance, alongside
other portfolio choices such as asset allocation decisions and active management. This contribution is rather
modest on average (between 4% and 10%), roughly two times lower than that made by active portfolio choices.

of Financial Crisis: Evidence from COVID-19 in China.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We examine the role of ESG performance during market-wide financial crisis, triggered in response to physical
and economic lockdowns arising from the COVID-19 global pandemic. These unique circumstances create an
inimitable opportunity to question if investors interpret ESG performance as a signal of future stock performance
and/or risk mitigation. Using a novel dataset covering China’s CSI300 constituents, we illustrate that (i) high
ESG portfolios tend to outperform low ESG portfolios (ii) that ESG performance mitigates financial risk during
financial crisis and (iii) the role of ESG performance is attenuated in ’normal’ times, confirming their incremental
importance during crisis. We phrase the results in the context of ESG investment practices.
Bruder, B., Cheikh, Y., Deixonne, F., and Zheng, B. (2019).“Integration of ESG in asset allocation.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
In this paper, we try to identify the relationship between the ESG scores and stocks’ performance and risk
measures. Using the ESG database of MSCI, we split the global investment universe into three regions: Europe,
North America and Asia-Paci c. The investment universe of each region is de ned by the components of the
corresponding MSCI index which is rebalanced every month. A simple statistical check allows us to verify the
integrity of the database. For the portfolio construction of E/S/G/ESG factors, the ESG scores are normalized
for all stocks in the same sector such that the sectorial bias is minimized. We nd that Governance score can signi
cantly improve the portfolio’s performance both in Europe and North America, meanwhile, the market of Asia-
Paci c is not sensitive to E/S/G/ESG scores. It is interesting to remark that the Governance factor in Europe
can be explained by traditional Quality factor, meaning that there is some equivalence between Governance
score and Quality indicators. In terms of risk measures, we observe that stocks with higher Governance and
Environmental scores are exposed to lower risks measured by maximum drawdown or volatility, for Europe and
North America. In Asia-Paci c, it is difficult to make any conclusion on the relationship between risk measures
and ESG scores.

solutions of some stochastic dominance portfolio models.” In: _Data in Brief_ 8, pp. 858–862.
A large number of portfolio selection models have appeared in the literature since the pioneering work of
Markowitz. However, even when computational and empirical results are described, they are often hard to
replicate and compare due to the unavailability of the datasets used in the experiments. We provide here several
datasets for portfolio selection generated using real-world price values from several major stock markets. The
datasets contain weekly return values, adjusted for dividends and for stock splits, which are cleaned from errors
as much as possible. The datasets are available in different formats, and can be used as benchmarks for testing the
performances of portfolio selection models and for comparing the efficiency of the algorithms used to solve them.
We also provide, for these datasets, the portfolios obtained by several selection strategies based on Stochastic
Dominance models (see ”On Exact and Approximate Stochastic Dominance Strategies for Portfolio Selection”
(Bruni et al. [2])). We believe that testing portfolio models on publicly available datasets greatly simplifies the
comparison of the different portfolio selection strategies.

strategies for portfolio selection.” In: _European Journal of Operational Research_ 259(1), pp. 322–329.
New type of approximate stochastic dominance designed for portfolio selection. Equivalent to minimizing the
expected shortfall of the portfolio below the benchmark. An easily solvable LP model for the practical implemen-
tation of our approach. Extensive empirical comparison of stochastic dominance models for portfolio selection.
One recent and promising strategy for Enhanced Indexation is the selection of portfolios that stochastically
dominate the benchmark. We propose here a new type of approximate stochastic dominance rule which implies
other existing approximate stochastic dominance rules. We then use it to find the portfolio that approximately
stochastically dominates a given benchmark with the best possible approximation. Our model is initially for-
mulated as a Linear Program with exponentially many constraints, and then reformulated in a more compact
manner so that it can be very efficiently solved in practice. This reformulation also reveals an interesting finan-
cial interpretation. We compare our approach with several exact and approximate stochastic dominance models
for portfolio selection. An extensive empirical analysis on real and publicly available datasets shows very good
out-of-sample performances of our model.

Returns.” In: _The Journal of Investing_ 31(3), pp. 45–61.
The authors construct ESG strategies that have been shown to outperform in popular articles. They assess
performance benefits to investors when accounting for sector and factor exposures. They find that most of the
outperformance of these strategies can be explained by their exposure to equity style factors that are mechanically
constructed from balance sheet information. This result is robust across different multifactor models. Further-
more, the ESG strategies tested show large sector biases. Removing these biases also removes outperformance.
They conclude that claims on ESG outperformance in popular articles are not valid.
Bryzgalova, S., Huang, J., and Julliard, C. (2021).“Bayesian solutions for the factor zoo: we just ran two quadrillion
models.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We propose a novel, and simple, Bayesian estimation and model selection procedure for cross-sectional asset
pricing. Our approach, that allows for both tradable and non-tradable factors, and is applicable to high dimen-
sional cases, has several desirable properties. First, weak and spurious factors lead to diffuse, and centered at
zero, posteriors for their market price of risk, making such factors easily detectable. Second, posterior inference is
robust to the presence of such factors. Third, we show that flat priors for risk premia lead to improper marginal
likelihoods, rendering model selection invalid. Therefore, we provide a novel prior, that is diffuse for strong
factors but shrinks away useless ones, under which posterior probabilities are well behaved, and can be used
for factor and (non necessarily nested) model selection, as well as model averaging, in large scale problems. We
apply our method to a very large set of factors proposed in the literature, and analyse 2.25 quadrillion possible
models, gaining novel insights on the empirical drivers of asset returns.
Bush, R., Chen, J., and Legunn, E. (2020).“E, S, or G - Analyzing Global ESG Performance.” In: _The Journal of
Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(2), pp. 16–25.
The authors propose a framework for analyzing the risk and return impact of environmental, social, and gover-
nance (ESG) investing across regional equity markets. By examining the performance of ESG through passive
index exposure via the MSCI ESG Leaders methodology, we seek to determine: 1) whether an ESG investment
has generated meaningful, statistically significant alpha in the single-index model, 2) if any such alpha does exist,
whether it is simply explained by known risk premia 3) in regions where ESG has empirically added meaningful
alpha, which of the three pillars, E, S, or G, has been the main determinant of this alpha, and whether the
sensitivity to each of the three pillars has changed over time, and 4) the extent to which any ESG alphas are
correlated across regions.

tunity Cost?” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 48(2), pp. 181–197.
This article examines factor investing in the presence of an environment, social, and governance (ESG) screening
overlay. The authors find that virtually no degradation in performance or turnover costs occur when using a
negative-based ESG screen (i.e., removing only companies that have an actively bad ESG score). However, there
are severe risk-induced performance issues and high transactions costs involved when the screening process
becomes more active and includes only companies that are ESG-forward. The authors find that this is true for
individually constructed factor portfolios, a composite benchmark of factor portfolios, and a stock selection model
constructed from factor scores. Interestingly, they find that both screening methodologies produce significant
improvement in ESG portfolio scores. They find very modest increases in turnover with the ESG screening of


bad companies and significant costs with the more aggressive ESG screening techniques. In general, the authors
conclude that ESG screening of negative companies is a positive way forward for agents who wish to add ESG
to their factor-based investment portfolios and that the method of implementing ESG makes a large difference
in outcomes.
Cakici, N. and Zaremba, A. (2021).“Responsible Investing: ESG Ratings and the Cross-Section of International
Stock Returns.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Does socially responsible investing pay off? The investigation of 49 developed and emerging markets indicates
that environmental, social, and governance ratings negatively predict future stock returns. A decile of global
stocks with the highest ESG scores underperforms their low-rated counterparts by 4.68% per year. However,
the superior returns on irresponsible companies are driven by the small firm effect. By buying unethical stocks,
investors harvest the size premium. Once its role is isolated, the ESG companies no longer differ from their
peers.
Caldeira, J. N. M. d. J. M. (2021).“Impact of ESG on financial performance on the most capitalized stock markets
: evidence from the USA Europe and Asia.” MA thesis. Universidade Catolica Portuguesa.
This paper analyzes the relationship between the corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score
and stock returns. Contrary to previous literature, this study covers two recent time frames, 2010-2018 and
2015-2018, in three different regions: USA, Europe, and Asia. To predict each ESG pillar’s effect on excess stock
returns, a regression model was used. This paper finds a negative impact of the Environmental score on excess
returns on the US, a positive impact of the Social score on the US and Asia and a positive impact of the ESG score
on stock returns in Asia. Additionally, resourcing to a portfolio construction method, this paper shows evidence
that portfolios containing the top ESG score stocks can outperform those containing the bottom ones. Between
2010 and 2018, there was evidence that a portfolio that buys (shorts) the best (worst) Governance score achieved
positive abnormal returns in Europe. In the 2015-2018 period, in the USA and Europe, a portfolio that buys
(shorts) the best (worst) ESG score stocks achieved positive abnormal returns. In Asia, there was no evidence of
positive abnormal returns. Although the relationship between ESG and stock returns will depend heavily on the
time frame and region, this paper showed clear benefits in adopting a socially responsible investment approach.
Furthermore, an ethical dilemma arises where investors must acknowledge that the returns obtained by a less
socially responsible portfolio with stocks linked with the production/distribution of tobacco, alcohol, firearms,
and fuels lead to higher returns comparing to ESG rich portfolios.
Calvo, C., Ivorra, C., and Liern, V. (2015).“Finding socially responsible portfolios close to conventional ones.” In:
_International Review of Financial Analysis_ 40, pp. 52–63.
An increasing number of investors are interested in sustainable, responsible and impact investment (SRI). How-
ever, there is a concern about the possible financial sacrifice associated to this kind of investments. The design
of Decision Support Systems assisting socially responsible investors in their investment decisions can contribute
to stimulate SRI. In this paper the financial content of a portfolio selection model is discussed in order to justify
that it can be integrated into a Decision Support System designed for investors interested in socially responsible
investment but initially reluctant to pay a financial cost in exchange for increasing the social responsibility of
their portfolios. Investor’s preferences are incorporated by means of adequate parameters of a utility function
designed for handling subjective criteria in a reliable way. We show that these parameters can be determined
by means of a non-technical questionnaire addressed to the investor, and that they can faithfully reflect his/her
preferences about achieving an SRI performance as good as possible without going too far from the financial
efficient frontier or even from an initial choice of an efficient pair of financial risk and return. The proposed
procedure is illustrated by means of two examples. A first small example illustrates the decision making process
followed in order to obtain the required parameters from the investor. The second example is intended to show
how the proposed procedure can be applied to real world problems including financial constraints which are
hard from a computational point of view.
Cao, J., Goyal, A., Zhan, X., and Zhang, W. E. (2021).“Unlocking ESG Premium from Options.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We find that option expensiveness, as measured by implied volatility, is higher for low-ESG stocks, showing that
investors pay a premium in the option market to hedge ESG-related uncertainty. Using delta-hedged option
returns, we estimate this ESG premium to be about 0.3% per month. All three components of ESG contribute
to option pricing. The effect of ESG performance heightens after the announcement of Paris Agreement, after
speeches of Greta Thunberg, and in the aftermath of Me-Too movement. We find that investors pay ESG
premium to hedge volatility, jump, and other higher moment risks. The influence of ESG on option premia is


stronger for firms that are closer to end-consumers, facing severer product competition, with higher investors’
ESG awareness, and without corporate hedging activity.
Cesarone, F., Martino, M. L., and Carleo, A. (2022).“Does ESG impact really enhances portfolio profitability?”
In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Over the last few decades, a growing attention to the Social Responsibility (SR) topic has affected financial
markets and institutional authorities. Indeed, recent environmental, social and financial crises have inevitably
led regulators and investors to take into account the sustainable investing issue. However, the question of how
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria impact financial portfolio performances, is still open. In
this work, we examine a multi-objective optimization model for portfolio selection, where we add to the classical
Mean-Variance analysis, a third non-financial goal represented by the ESG scores. The resulting optimization
problem, formulated as a (convex) Quadratic Programming (QP), consists in minimizing the portfolio variance
with parametric lower bounds on the levels of the portfolio expected return and ESG. We provide here an
extensive empirical analysis on five datasets involving real-world capital market indices from major stock markets.
Our empirical findings typically reveal the presence of two behavioral patterns for the 16 Mean-Variance-ESG
portfolios analyzed. Indeed, over the last fifteen years we can distinguish two non-overlapping time windows
on which the inclusion of portfolio ESG targets leads to different regimes in terms of portfolio profitability.
Furthermore, on the most recent time window we observe that, for the US markets, imposing a high ESG target
tends to select portfolios that show better financial performances than the other strategies, whereas for the
European markets the ESG constraint does not seem to improve the portfolio profitability.
Cesarone, F., Moretti, J., and Tardella, F. (2018).“Why Small Portfolios Are Preferable and How to Choose Them.”
In: _SSRN e-Print_.
One of the fundamental principles in portfolio selection models is minimization of risk through diversification of
the investment. However, this principle does not necessarily translate into a request for investing in all the assets
of the investment universe. Indeed, following a line of research started by Evans and Archer almost 50 years
ago, we provide here further evidence that small portfolios are sufficient to achieve almost optimal in-sample
risk reduction with respect to variance and to some other popular risk measures, and very good out-of-sample
performances. While leading to similar results, our approach is significantly different from the classical one
pioneered by Evans and Archer. Indeed, we describe models for choosing the portfolio of a prescribed size with
the smallest possible risk, as opposed to the random portfolio choice investigated in most of the previous works.
We find that the smallest risk portfolios generally require no more than 15 assets. Furthermore, it is almost
always possible to find portfolios that are just 1% more risky than the smallest risk portfolios and contain no
more than 10 assets. The preference for small optimal portfolios is also justified by recent theoretical results on
the estimation errors for the parameters required by portfolio selection models. Our empirical analysis is based
on some new and on some publicly available benchmark data sets often used in the literature.
Cesarone, F., Mottura, C., Ricci, J. M., and Tardella, F. (2019).“On the stability of portfolio selection models.” In:
_SSRN e-Print_.
One of the main issues in portfolio selection models consists in assessing the effect of the estimation errors of the
parameters required by the models on the quality of the selected portfolios. Several studies have been devoted to
this topic for the minimum variance and for several other minimum risk models. However, no sensitivity analysis
seems to have been reported for the recent popular Risk Parity diversification approach, nor for other portfolio
selection models requiring maximum gain-risk ratios.Based on artificial and real-world data, we provide here
empirical evidence showing that the Risk Parity model is always the most stable one in all the cases analyzed.
Furthermore, the minimum risk models are typically more stable than the maximum gain-risk models, with the
minimum variance model often being the preferable one.

Investing_ 1(1), pp. 26–45.
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) signals are an important part of factor-based investing strategies
as they can stem from the same economic rationales as general factor premiums. Because factors are broad
and diversified, building portfolios by jointly optimizing factor exposures with ESG and carbon outcomes can
result in similar historical performance as benchmark factor portfolios that do not include those considerations.
We show how sustainable signals, which often involve alternative data, can be integrated in the definitions of
factors themselves: We offer two examples on green intangible value and corporate culture quality which enhance
traditional financial value and quality factors, respectively.

are GAMs?” In: _Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining_.
ACM.
Generalized additive models (GAMs) have become a leading model class for interpretable machine learning.
However, there are many algorithms for training GAMs, and these can learn different or even contradictory
models, while being equally accurate. Which GAM should we trust? In this paper, we quantitatively and quali-
tatively investigate a variety of GAM algorithms on real and simulated datasets. We find that GAMs with high
feature sparsity (only using a few variables to make predictions) can miss patterns in the data and be unfair to
rare subpopulations. Our results suggest that inductive bias plays a crucial role in what interpretable models
learn and that tree-based GAMs represent the best balance of sparsity, fidelity and accuracy and thus appear
to be the most trustworthy GAM models.

Across Time Horizons.” In: _Management Science_ 65(9), pp. 4440–4450.
The value added by an active investor is traditionally measured using alpha, tracking error, and the information
ratio. However, these measures do not characterize the dynamic component of investor activity, nor do they
consider the time horizons over which weights are changed. In this paper, we propose a technique to measure the
value of active investment that captures both the static and dynamic contributions of an investment process. This
dynamic alpha is based on the decomposition of a portfolio’s expected return into its frequency components using
spectral analysis. The result is a static component that measures the portion of a portfolio’s expected return
resulting from passive investments and security selection and a dynamic component that captures the manager’s
timing ability across a range of time horizons. Our framework can be universally applied to any portfolio and
is a useful method for comparing the forecast power of different investment processes. Several analytical and
empirical examples are provided to illustrate the practical relevance of this decomposition.

Social Ratings.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We analyze the risk and return characteristics across firms sorted by their environmental and social (ES) ratings.
We document that ES ratings have no significant relationship with average stock returns or unconditional market
risk. Stocks of firms with higher ES ratings do have significantly lower systematic downside risk. Such reduction in
downside risk delivers modest, yet non-trivial, gain in long-term returns of around 0.96% per annum. Realized
firm news sentiment and institutional trading patterns are also consistent with these results. Our evidence
suggests that investors who derive non-pecuniary benefits from ES investing need not sacrifice performance in
the stock market.

In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(1), pp. 47–73.
In the face of accelerating climate change, investors are making capital allocations seeking to decarbonize port-
folios by reducing the carbon intensity of their holdings. To understand the performance of portfolio decar-
bonization strategies and investor behavior toward decarbonization, the authors construct decarbonization fac-
tors that go long low-carbon-intensity and short high-carbon-intensity sectors, industries, or companies. They
consider several portfolio formation strategies and find that strategies that lowered carbon emissions more ag-
gressively performed better. Decarbonization factor returns are associated with contemporaneous institutional
flows into the factors. Buying decarbonization factors when coincident flows are positive while selling when
they are negative produces significantly positive alphas. Combining decarbonization factors that have positive
contemporaneous flows would provide investors with significantly superior returns and continuous exposure to
low-carbon portfolios. The results are more pronounced in Europe relative to the United States. The results
suggest that institutional investor flows contain information about anticipated fundamentals related to climate
change developments.

ESG investing is an area of active interest for both the investment and academic communities. Despite the
intense interest, there currently is no agreed upon definition of ESG investing, or how to best build investment
portfolios that incorporate both return and sustainability dimensions. (Both are important for sustainability-
minded investors.) In this article, the authors categorize the broad types of ESG investing currently in the
market and introduce an ESG investment framework. This results in a portfolio that optimally combines the
dual objectives of alpha and sustainability outperformance.

Alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(2).
This article uses advanced natural language processing NLP methods to identify companies that are aligned
with the UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs based on the text in their sustainability disclosures. Using
the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports of Russell 1000 companies between 2010-2019, we apply a
logistic classifier, support vector machines (SVM), and a fully connected neural network to predict alignment
with the SDGs. Specifically, we use word embeddings to augment dictionary-based input features, as well as the
embeddings as features themselves, based on Word2Vec and Doc2Vec models to classify companies’ alignment
with the SDGs over time. Notably, the Doc2Vec embedding inputs to the SVM classifier result in high average
accuracy of above 80% for predicting alignment.
Chen, M., von Behren, R., and Mussalli, G. (2021).“The Unreasonable Attractiveness of More ESG Data.” In: _The
Journal of Portfolio Management_ 48(1), pp. 147–162.
Sustainable investing is of tremendous interest in both academia and the investment industry. However, despite
the interest and the surge in assets under management (AUM) inflow, environment, social, and governance (ESG)
data currently remain a fundamental challenge because they are deficient in quantity, consistency, and quality.
In light of this data challenge, many investors and academics have come to rely on commercial ESG raters to
assess the ESG quality of various corporations. However, the commercial ESG ratings still suffer some notable
biases. This article documents one possible bias, termed quantity bias. The authors find that the amount of ESG
data available for a given company is positively correlated with the commercial ESG rating of that company
and the weighted average cost of its capital. The implication for investors is that they should do their homework
and examine what the ESG data actually say rather than simply check the box. For corporations, it implies that
they will get favorable treatment in the capital market if they publish more ESG data.
Chen, S. and Bowler, M. (2021).“Constructing and Validating Climate Risk Factors from ESG Data: an Empirical
Comparison.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Increased concern about climate change has led many investors to focus on its effects on portfolio returns. ESG
metrics used for analyzing climate risks, however, have been shown to be inconsistent. What would happen
if they were used in analyzing the climate risks of portfolios and making climate-aligned investments? In this
paper, we look at different ways to incorporate ESG metrics into the investment process by creating climate
factors for use with multi-factor equity returns models. We found that different ESG metrics do indeed lead
to very different, sometimes even opposite, investment recommendations. At the same time, it was possible to
create at least one climate factor from Exchange Traded Funds which could be used to identify investment
opportunities and monitor climate risks in the Energy industry. This suggests that the market is trading to a
systematic climate factor in at least one industry. The methodologies in this paper for validating the climate
factors created from ESG metrics could be used to develop climate factors for other industries. It could also be
used to test the validity of ESG metrics and of the integration of climate risk analysis into managers’ investment
processes.
Chen, Y. and Deleon, A. (2020).“Financial Quality Metrics and ESG Factor Interactions in Equity Markets.” In:
_The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(2), pp. 7–15.
As investor’s interests in indexes tilt toward quality factors grow, many of them mistakenly conflate ESG
(environmental, social, and governance) factors with quality factors when they seek to integrate ESG data into
their investment process. This article offers a different perspective on the relationship between quality factors and
ESG factors, as well as the financial materiality of different multifactor combinations of quality and ESG factors
across six-year monthly rebalanced in-sample backtests (June 28, 2013 to April 30, 2019) on the Russell 1000
Index, Russell 2000 Index, and MSCI EAFE Index. The authors compare the return streams and correlations
of ROE, ROA, ROIC, MSCI IVA Score, and their corresponding equal-weighted multifactor combinations. The
ESG and financial quality factors are uncorrelated, suggesting that well-rated ESG companies are not always
high-quality companies. In some cases, the combination of quality and ESG is a stronger predictor for high
returns than either quality factor or ESG factor alone.
Choi, D., Gao, Z., and Jiang, W. (2020).“Measuring the carbon exposure of institutional investors.” In: _The Journal
of Alternative Investments_ 23(1), pp. 12–23.
The authors introduce a simple definition of carbon-intensive firms to measure institutional investors exposure
to the emission intensities of portfolio companies. The definition is based on major emission industry sectors
identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). All firms in these industries are classified
as carbon-intensive. The authors show that 13F institutions, on average, gradually reduce their carbon exposure


relative to the US value-weighted market portfolio, from overweighting stocks of high-emission firms by 0.5%
in 2001 to underweighting by 0.2%-0.7% since 2015, consistent with the view that investors have become more
concerned about the financial implications of climate change. Compared with firm-level emission data obtained
from vendors, the authors measure is free from selection issues and can be extended to early periods and to
international markets, as it only depends on industry classifications and covers all stocks. The authors do not
find the same divestment trend before 2000, when climate risks were less eminent.

Socially conscious individual investors face a host of challenges, not least of which are a stock buy list screened by
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, and investment strategies that are easily implementable.
In this study, we addressed these issues by utilizing a publicly available ESG stock list (100 Best Corporate
Citizens) with investment strategies involving low-volatility investing, mean-variance optimization, and equally
weighted approach, and introducing an innovative method in estimating the return premium due to survivorship
bias. Over the period under review, the various strategies and shortlisted ESG stock mutual funds outperformed
the SandP 500 index.

Performance.” In: _Risks_ 9(10), p. 172.
This paper illustrates the impact of Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure on European cor-
porate equity performance. In this study, we use an extensive data set of European ESG ratings provided by
Bloomberg to demonstrate that ESG disclosure is associated with improved return growth, with the Governance
pillar exhibiting the strongest effect on corporate performance. The impact of ESG disclosure on volatility
is changing over time, suggesting that the existence of opaque ratings limits the transmission of information
disclosure into corporate performance.

The research on sustainable finance has intensified in the past decade. In this survey, we synthesize recent
academic results and models on socially responsible investing (SRI) in equity markets. We split our review
into six thematic parts: data issues, investor preferences, link with financial performance, portfolio integration,
climate change risk, and theoretical models.
Coqueret, G. (2022a). _Perspectives in sustainable equity investing_. Boca Raton: CRC Press. 140 pp.
Sustainable investing has recently gained traction throughout the world. This trend has multiple sources, which
span from genuine ethical concerns to hopes of performance boosting, and also encompass risk mitigation. The
resulting appetite for green assets is impacting the decisions of many investors. Perspectives in Sustainable Equity
Investing is an up-to-date review of the academic literature on sustainable equity investing. It covers more than
800 academic sources grouped into six thematic chapters. Designed for corporate sustainability and financial
management professionals, this is an ideal reference for ESG-driven financiers (both retail and institutional).
Students majoring in finance or economics with some background or interest in ESG concerns would also find
this compact overview useful.
Coqueret, G. (2022b). _Perspectives in sustainable equity investing (website version)_.
This website is periodically updated. The printed version of the book is published by CRC Press, This short book
is a large-scale literature review on the topic of sustainable equity investing. It covers more than 900 academic
sources (research articles, overwhelmingly), grouped into six thematic chapters. As such, it can serve as reference
for analysts and researchers who work on environmental, social or governance (ESG)-driven portfolios. The book
assumes no prior knowledge of this field, but some parts, especially the last chapter, can be rather technical
mathematically. While the sheer number of references may seem exhaustive, the survey only scratches the
surface of the topic because the amount of contributions is daunting. The best round estimate on the pace of
the development of the literature is roughly two serious papers per day (based on one year of compiling research
output). The intellectual production on this matter is such that surveying a narrow subfield thereof can take
weeks. In addition, all facets of the issue are interconnected, so that it does not make any sense to consider
them separately. Focusing on pure ESG integration without notions in climate change risk is ill-advised. The
big picture matters. Briefly, we outline the chapters of the book below.

- Chapter 2 introduces a large number of terms to make sure the reader familiarizes with the jargon and
    nomenclature.
- In Chapter 3, we cover the broad theme of green investors, including their beliefs, preferences, and practices,
    as well as the topic of impact investing.


- Chapter 4, which is the core of the book, is dedicated to the very complex relationship between ESG
    investing and financial performance.
- Technical details on how to integrate sustainable criteria in complex portfolio optimization are provided in
    Chapter 5.
- The subject of climate change (its measurement, impact, and how to tackle it) is treated in Chapter 6.
- Finally, Chapter 7 is dedicated to theoretical models related to ESG investing and to the push for sustain-
    ability more broadly in the economy.
The review is compact, meaning that we favored concision to in-depth treatment. The monograph is intended
as a thematic compass, pointing towards some relevant directions. For many topics, the interested reader will
have to satisfy his or her curiosity by examining the mentioned references.

ESG-Based Optimization With Asset Pricing Characteristics.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This article investigates the usefulness of combining traditional factors with ESG data when building optimal
equity portfolios. Our contribution departs from the traditional literature by focusing on allocations designed
to adjust benchmark policies. We allow compositions to be embedded in a general factor framework in which
firm characteristics are the main drivers of the portfolio weights. In line with much of the literature, our results
suggest that it is feasible to improve the ESG score of a portfolio without it being detrimental to its out-of-
sample performance. However, pure sustainable attributes alone do not allow to fulfil this objective: they need
to be boosted by non-ESG predictors to deliver their full potential.

Coqueret, G. and Tran, V. L. (2022).“ESG news spillovers to (and from) the supply chain.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
In this article, we document the impact of ESG shocks on the returns of suppliers and clients of affected firms.
Our equilibrium model suggests that this impact is contingent not only on the sign and magnitude of the shock,
but also on the product between the shock and the level of the ESG score. An empirical analysis of US stocks,
along with their global clients and suppliers, reveals that ESG shocks are integrated into prices intra-daily and
that the cross-effect between shocks and ESG levels is statistically significant. The indirect diffusion of ESG
shocks to customers’ and suppliers’ returns is also significant, but takes more time (a few days) and is less
pronounced.
Cornell, B. (2020).“ESG Investing: Conceptual Issues.” In: _The Journal of Wealth Management_ 23(3), pp. 61–69.
Using criteria based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations has become an increasingly
important aspect of investment decision making, particularly for high-profile institutional investors. As of 2019,
sustainable assets under management were estimated to be 30 trillio USDn worldwide. The claim here is that the
enthusiasm for ESG investing has been exaggerated for three reasons. First, it is not clear what constitutes an
ESG investment in the context of a complex, integrated economy. Second, the impact on investment performance
of a preference for ESG investments has not been sufficiently recognized outside academic circles. Finally, many
leading practitioners have stated that the importance of ESG considerations implies that the corporate objective
of maximizing shareholder value, which lies at the core of much of finance theory, is outdated and needs to be
replaced by a more comprehensive stakeholder model. The conclusion is that both the benefits of the traditional
model and the dangers of a broader stakeholder model have not be adequately appreciated.
Cornell, B. (2021a).“ESG preferences, risk and return.” In: _European Financial Management_ 27(1), pp. 12–19.
There are two primary factors that affect expected returns for companies with high ESG (environmental, social
and governance) ratings-investor preferences and risk. Although investor preferences for highly rated ESG com-
panies can lower the cost of capital, the flip side of the coin is lower expected returns for investors. Regarding
risk, the jury remains out on whether there is an ESG-related risk factor. However, to the extent, ESG is a risk


factor it also points towards lower expected returns for investments in highly rated companies. Though ESG
investing may have social benefits, higher expected returns for investors are not among them.
Cornell, B. (2021b).“Is the Stock Market Worried About Climate Change? Lessons from the 2010s.” In: _The Journal
of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(3), pp. 51–58.
On Christmas Eve 2019, the MIT Technology Review published an article entitled ”The 2010s Were Another
Lost Decade on Climate Change.” On New Year’s Day, the Washington Post published a longer article with
the same title. Both pieces told basically the same story, one repeated by many environmentalists and climate
experts, the failure to take meaningful action on climate change in the 2010s had dramatically exacerbated
the problem. This article investigates how the stock market reacted to the negative climate-related news that
emerged during the 2010s. The results suggest that at an aggregate level the stock market was unconcerned
about the climate news, implying that the market believed that climate change would not have a major impact
on future macroeconomic growth. There is evidence, however, that the market concluded that climate issues
would be a significant problem for fossil fuel companies.
Cornell, B. and Damodaran, A. (2020).“Valuing ESG: Doing Good or Sounding Good?” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
In the last decade, companies have come under pressure to be socially conscious and environmentally responsi-
ble, with the pressure coming sometimes from politicians, regulators and interest groups, and sometimes from
investors. The argument that corporate managers should replace their singular focus on shareholders with a
broader vision, where they also serve other stakeholders, including customers, employees and society, has found
a receptive audience with corporate CEOs and institutional investors. The pitch that companies should focus on
”doing good” is sweetened with the promise that it will also be good for their bottom line and for shareholders.
In this paper, we build a framework for value that will allow us to examine how being socially responsible can
manifest in the tangible ingredients of value and look at the evidence for whether being socially responsible is
creating value for companies and for investors.
Cosemans, M., Hut, X., and Dijk, M. A. V. (2021).“Climate Change and Long-Horizon Portfolio Choice: Combining
Theory and Empirics.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We propose a novel approach for measuring the impact of climate change on long-horizon equity risk and
optimal portfolio choice. Our method combines historical data about the impact of climate change on return
dynamics with prior beliefs elicited from the temperature long-run risk (LRR-T) model of Bansal, Kiku, and
Ochoa (2019). Our Bayesian framework incorporates this prior information to obtain more precise estimates of
long-term climate risks than existing methods that solely rely on historical data. Compared to the benchmark
investor without climate change, we document that the LRR-T Bayesian investor predicts higher equity premia
for all investment horizons, with per period variance increasing considerably over the horizon. This results in
relatively (high) low allocations to equities in the (short) long run. Investors that optimize between portfolios
that are vulnerable and non-vulnerable to climate change only diversify in the long run.

learning approach.” In: _Decisions in Economics and Finance_ 44(2), pp. 1087–1110.
Sustainable and responsible finance incorporates Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into
business decisions and investment strategies. In recent years, investors have rushed to Sustainable and Responsi-
ble Investments in response to growing concerns about the risks of climate change. Asset managers look for some
assessment of sustainability for guidance and benchmarking, for instance, USD30 trillion of assets are invested
using some ESG ratings. Several studies argue that good ESG ratings helped to prop up stock returns during the
2008 Global Financial Crisis. The ESG score represents a benchmark of disclosures on public and private firms,
it is based on different characteristics which are not directly related to the financial performance (Harvard Law
School Forum on Corporate Governance, ESG reports and ratings:what they are, why they matter). The role of
ESG ratings and their reliability have been widely discussed (Berg et al. Aggregate confusion: the divergence of
ESG ratings, MIT Sloan Research Paper No. 5822-19, 2019). Sustainable investment professionals are unsatisfied
with publicly traded companies’ climate-related disclosure. This negative sentiment is particularly strong in the
USA, and within asset managers who do not believe that markets are consistently and correctly pricing climate
risks into company and sector valuations. We believe that ESG ratings, when available, still affect business
and finance strategies and may represent a crucial element in the company’s fundraising process and on shares
returns. We aim to assess how structural data as balance sheet items and income statements items for traded
companies affect ESG scores. Using the Bloomberg ESG scores, we investigate the role of structural variables
adopting a machine learning approach, in particular, the Random Forest algorithm. We use balance sheet data
for a sample of the constituents of the Euro Stoxx 600 index, referred to the last decade, and investigate how


these explain the ESG Bloomberg ratings. We find that financial statements items represent a powerful tool to
explain the ESG score.
Dash, G. H. and Kajiji, N. (2021).“Behavioral Portfolio Management with Layered ESG Goals and AI Estimation
of Asset Returns.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Portfolio managers and individual investors alike are in quest of efficient asset allocation models that simul-
taneously express environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations along with investor behavioral
biases. The current study presents a novel approach to optimize the behavioral portfolio management model
in the presence of investor biases for ESG sustainability, loss aversion, and cognitive dissonance. We extend
the factor pricing literature by implementing a factor extraction protocol to identify three unique and perva-
sive ESG factors. Upon examining the interconnectedness of the factors, machine learning methods are applied
to a production-theoretic six-factor Fama and French model to predict individual asset returns. Enumeration
of efficient asset allocations is obtained by solving a hierarchical multiobjective portfolio optimization model.
simulation results from solving alternate specifications of the layered goal ESG-driven model corroborate and
extend emergent research on portfolio sustainability, network theory, and the interconnectedness of financial
returns. Additionally, we provide results to amplify the existence of a hump-shaped ESG efficiency frontier. The
results provide new information about the trade-offs available for resolving cognitive dissonance when investors
are conflicted between holding ’green’ versus ’brown’ asset diversification plans.
De, I. and Clayman, M. R. (2015).“The Benefits of Socially Responsible Investing: An Active Manager’s Perspec-
tive .” In: _The Journal of Investing_ 24(4), pp. 49–72.
There has been a lot of research on the predictive power of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings,
the relationship between ESG ratings and subsequent stock performance, and whether using ESG data in stock
analysis and portfolio management was value-additive or valuedetracting. In this article, the authors examine
the relationship between the ESG ratings of a company and its stock returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted
returns in the post-2008 financial crisis era. They explore the negative relationship between ESG and volatility
in greater depth, given the well-documented low-volatility anomaly (outperformance of low-volatility stocks).
Both (high) ESG rating and (low) volatility positively impact stock returns, but the ESG effect is independent
of the low-volatility effect, and ESG is a positive contributor in its own right. Given the controversy surrounding
the effect of ESG-based investment restrictions, the authors test the effect of restricting the investible universe
by deleting the lower tail of ESG companies on portfolio performance. Asset managers can thus actively use
the association between corporate ESG ratings and stock return, volatility, and risk-adjusted return to enhance
their stock-picking and portfolio-construction abilities.
De Franco, C. (2019).“ESG Controversies and Their Impact on Performance.” In: _The Journal of Investing_ 29(2),
pp. 33–45.
This article introduces an aggregated controversy metric-derived from environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) data-that targets specific issues companies face in the environmental, social, or governance fields. By
building portfolios based on this controversy measure, the study shows that in Europe and the US, stocks that
undergo severe controversies significantly underperform both their benchmarks and other portfolios consisting of
stocks with low controversy or no controversy at all. The main reason for this result is that, in both cases, markets
tend to react strongly to changes in controversy levels, penalizing stocks that experience ESG downgrades.
These results make a clear case for the potential benefits of excluding stocks with high controversy levels from
investment universes. However, these findings are not confirmed for the Asia-Pacific region, where the portfolios
consisting of highly controversial stocks outperform their benchmarks, although the number of such portfolios
is lower compared to the number in Europe and the US.
De Franco, C., Geissler, C., Margot, V., and Monnier, B. (2020).“ESG investments: Filtering versus machine
learning approaches.” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
We designed a machine learning algorithm that identifies patterns between ESG profiles and financial per-
formances for companies in a large investment universe. The algorithm consists of regularly updated sets of
rules that map regions into the high-dimensional space of ESG features to excess return predictions. The final
aggregated predictions are transformed into scores which allow us to design simple strategies that screen the
investment universe for stocks with positive scores. By linking the ESG features with financial performances in a
non-linear way, our strategy based upon our machine learning algorithm turns out to be an efficient stock pick-
ing tool, which outperforms classic strategies that screen stocks according to their ESG ratings, as the popular
best-in-class approach. Our paper brings new ideas in the growing field of financial literature that investigates
the links between ESG behavior and the economy. We show indeed that there is clearly some form of alpha in


the ESG profile of a company, but that this alpha can be accessed only with powerful, non-linear techniques
such as machine learning.
De Franco, C., Nicolle, J., and Tran, L.-A. (2021).“Sustainable Investing: ESG versus SDG.” In: _The Journal of
Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(4), pp. 45–62.
In this article, we compare the established ESG-oriented to the more recent SDG-driven investment strategies in
the United States and Europe. We have built cap-weighted portfolios based on ESG scores (Low, Mid, High) and
comparable portfolios based on SDG scores. In the observed period, we show that most of the SDG premium is
driven by the sector allocation effect: Technology in the United States and Healthcare in Europe. Thus, we have
built sector-adjusted ESG and SDG portfolios to cope with the sector bias. This entails the reduction of the
structural sector differences in SDG ratings. Interestingly, although the premium between high- and low-rated
SDG stocks vanishes in the US case, the European case exhibits a strong positive premium. Finally, integrating
SDG components in investment decisions will certainly be the standard in the years to come, but investors
should be aware of the potential undesired bias implied by such an approach.
De Spiegeleer, J., Hocht, S., Jakubowski, D., Reyners, S., and Schoutens, W. (2020).“ESG: A New Dimension in
Portfolio Allocation.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
In this paper, we examine the impact of including environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in the
allocation of equity portfolios. We focus on the risk and return characteristics of the resulting ESG portfolios
and investment strategies. Two specific measures are considered to quantify the ESG performance of a company;
the ESG rating and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity. For both measures, we carry out empirical
portfolio analyses with assets in either the STOXX Europe 600 or the Russell 1000 index. The ESG rating data
analysis does not provide clear-cut evidence for enhanced performance of portfolios with either high or low ESG
scores. We moreover illustrate that the choice of rating agency has a significant impact on the performance of the
resulting ESG-constrained portfolios. Secondly, we study the impact of GHG emission reductions and increases.
We show that emission reductions do not necessarily lead to increased risk or diminished returns, which gives
confidence in a smooth transition towards the green economy pursued by the European Green Deal.
Dimson, E., Marsh, P., and Staunton, M. (2020).“Divergent ESG Ratings.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_
47(1), pp. 75–87.
Responsible investors require data to underpin their stock and sector selections. Regardless of the rating agency,
bond ratings for a particular issuer are broadly similar. This is not the case for ESG ratings. Companies with
a high score from one rater often receive a middling or low score from another rater. This article examines the
extent of, and reasons for, disagreement among the leading suppliers of ESG ratings. The weightings given to
each pillar of an ESG rating also vary across agencies. Many asset managers contend that ESG ratings can
help investors to select assets with superior financial prospects, and the authors therefore review the investment
performance of portfolios and of indexes screened for their ESG credentials. In the authors’ opinion, ESG ratings,
used in isolation, are unlikely to make a material contribution to portfolio returns.

In: _Management Science_ 61(9), pp. 2185–2202.
We evaluate the out-of-sample performance of a long-term investor who follows an optimized dynamic trading
strategy. Although the dynamic strategy is able to benefit from predictability out-of-sample, a short-term investor
using a single-period market timing strategy would have realized an almost identical performance. The value
of intertemporal hedge demands in strategic asset allocation appears negligible. The result is caused by the
estimation error in predicting the predictors. A myopic investor only needs to predict one-period-ahead expected
returns, but hedge demands also require accurate predictions of the predictor variables. To reduce the problem
of errors in optimized portfolio weights, we consider Bayesian procedures. Myopic and dynamic portfolios are
similarly affected by such modifications, and differences in performance become even smaller.

rising importance of ESG.” In: _Finance Research Letters_ 38 (101870).
We investigate the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings in explaining different
industry returns during the Covid-19 window. We build our ESG factor as the spread in returns between firms
in the top ESG quartile and those in the bottom ESG quartile. The ESG factor shows to significantly explain
industry returns in addition to the Fama-French factors. We also analyze the individual Environmental, Social,
and Governance components of ESG. Environmental and Social dimensions are the main drivers of the ESG
impact on different industries.


Drei, A., Le Guenedal, T., Lepetit, F., Mortier, V., Roncalli, T., and Sekine, T. (2019).“ESG Investing in Recent
Years: New Insights from Old Challenges.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This research is an update of the study that we published last year (Bennani et al., 2018) and that explored
the impact of ESG investing on asset pricing in the stock market. It extends the original period 2010-2017 by
adding eighteen months from January 2018 to June 2019. These new results confirm the previous results as we
reach the same essential conclusions once again. ESG investing tended to penalize both passive and active ESG
investors between 2010 and 2013. Contrastingly, ESG investing was a source of outperformance from 2014 to
2019 in Europe and North America. Moreover, ESG can be considered as a risk factor in the Eurozone, while
it continues to be an alpha strategy in North America. However, the last 18 months exhibit new interesting
patterns. First, we observe a transatlantic divide since the results for North America and the Eurozone are
different for the recent period. Second, we document a partial ordering between ESG ratings and performance
that can be explained by a shift from a static to a dynamic approach to ESG investing. Third, we note some
discrepancies between active and passive management. Fourth, the social pillar seems to have gained traction
these last years, and is no longer the laggard pillar. Fifth, factor investing and ESG investing are more and more
connected. In what follows, we develop and explain these five key findings.
Duan, T., Li, F. W., and Wen, Q. (2021).“Is Carbon Risk Priced in the Cross Section of Corporate Bond Returns?”
In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This paper examines the pricing of a firm’s carbon risk, measured by its carbon emissions intensity, in the cross
section of corporate bond returns. Contrary to the ”carbon risk premium” hypothesis, we find bonds of firms with
higher carbon emissions intensity earn significantly lower returns. This effect cannot be explained by a compre-
hensive list of bond characteristics and exposure to known risk factors. Investigating sources of the low carbon
premium, we find the underperformance of bonds issued by carbon-intensive firms cannot be fully explained
by divestment from institutional investors. Instead, our evidence is most consistent with investor underreaction
to carbon risk, as carbon emissions intensity is predictive of lower future cash flow news, deteriorating firm
creditworthiness, more environmental incidents, and elevated downside risks.
Dumitrescu, A., Gil-Bazo, J., and Zhou, F. (2022).“Defining Greenwashing.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We propose a precise definition of greenwashing by mutual funds that combines ESG self-labels, sustainability
scores of portfolio holdings, and funds’ voting behavior. Armed with this definition, we are able to quantify the
prevalence of greenwashing in the US mutual fund industry. Although self labeled ESG funds dominate non-ESG
funds in terms of ESG ratings and voting support for ESG proposals, 24% of them are greenwashers according
to our definition. Greenwashers are more likely to belong to larger and older fund families and less likely to
be offered by signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment. Importantly, while retail
investors do not distinguish between greenwashers and true ESG funds, institutional investors are not deceived
by the former. Our results suggest that accusations of ubiquitous greenwashing in asset management exaggerate
the true extent of the problem. However, there is room for regulation aimed at enhanced ESG disclosure, at
least for those funds that target retail investors.

of Financial Studies_ 33(3), pp. 1184–1216.
We propose and implement a procedure to dynamically hedge climate change risk. We extract innovations from
climate news series that we construct through textual analysis of newspapers. We then use a mimicking portfolio
approach to build climate change hedge portfolios. We discipline the exercise by using third-party ESG scores
of firms to model their climate risk exposures. We show that this approach yields parsimonious and industry-
balanced portfolios that perform well in hedging innovations in climate news both in sample and out of sample.
We discuss multiple directions for future research on financial approaches to managing climate risk.

Multiple Tests.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 45(1), pp. 141–147.
Selection bias under multiple testing is a serious problem. From a practitioner perspective, failure to disclose
the impact of multiple tests of a proposed investment strategy to clients and senior management can lead to
the adoption of a false discovery. Clients will lose money, senior management will misallocate resources, and
the firm may be exposed to reputational, legal, and regulatory risks. From the perspective of academic journals
that publish evidence supporting an investment strategy, the failure to address selection bias under multiple
testing threatens to invalidate large portions of the literature in empirical finance. In this article, the authors
propose a template that practitioners should use to fairly disclose multiple tests involved in an alleged discovery
when pitching strategies to clients and senior management. The same template could be used by contributors to


academic journals so that referees, and ultimately readers, can assess the strategy. By disclosing this information,
those who are charged with making the final decision about a discovery can evaluate the probability that the
purported discovery is false.
Faccini, R., Matin, R., and Skiadopoulos, G. (2021).“Dissecting Climate Risks: Are they Reflected in Stock Prices?”
In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We provide first-time evidence on whether market-wide physical or transition climate risks are priced in U.S.
stocks. Textual and narrative analysis of Reuters climate-change news over 2000-2018, uncovers four novel risk
factors related to natural disasters, global warming, international summits, and U.S. climate policy, respectively.
Only the climate-policy factor is priced, especially post-2012. The documented risk premium is consistent with
investors hedging the imminent transition risks from government intervention, rather than the direct risks from
climate change itself. Firms that are most exposed to transition risks tend to be polluting businesses which show
no strong intention of becoming greener.
Filbeck, A., Filbeck, G., and Zhao, X. (2019).“Performance assessment of firms following sustainalytics ESG
principles.” In: _The Journal of Investing_ 28(2), pp. 7–20.
The authors explore whether firms rated highly by Sustainalytics based on ESG criteria are rewarded with
superior long-term stock price performance. They find that firms with the highest ESG ratings statistically
outperform the SandP 500 index, although not on a risk-adjusted basis. Firms with higher governance and
social scores also statistically outperform those firms with corresponding lower scores. Firms with better (worse)
governance scores produce statistically significant positive (negative) alpha values. Firms less likely to adhere
to strong governance principles are penalized in the market, while firms more likely following strong social and
environmental principles are negatively assessed. Improved governance scores and to a lesser extent improved
social scores produce statistically significant positive alpha values whereas negative changes in environmental
scores are positively received by the market. Overall, investors are not hurt by following an ESG philosophy
with the market rewarding firms for good governance, penalizing those with strong environmental records, and
meeting with ambivalence those with strong social records.
Fiordelisi, F., Galloppo, G., Lattanzio, G., and Paimanova, V. (2021).“An ESG Ratings Free Assessment of Socially
Responsible Investment Strategies.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings feature statistical and economic problems undermining
their reliability as valid proxies for corporates’ social performance. To overcome this ratings providers specific
bias, we focus on global sample of ESG-oriented Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Studying passive and pre-
committed strategies provide us with several economic and econometric advantages, allowing us to document that
Socially Responsible Investments (SRI)-oriented strategies generate significantly higher average stock market
returns and liquidity. However, the identified overperformance is concentrated in months of extreme climate
activity, while the effect reverses during financial crisis. These findings confirm that investors react to non-
pecuniary shocks by increasing the weights assigned to SRI investments in their portfolio, but their preference
shifts back towards traditional strategies during economic downturns.
Fish, A., Kim, D. H., and Venkatraman, S. (2019).“The ESG Sacrifice.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Socially Responsible investing has become a key point of discussion within the past few years as society gravitates
towards producing positive externalities. The topic remains greatly contested especially when considering the
perspectives of Milton Friedman, who claimed the sole focus of any publicly-traded company is to generate
positive growth and performance for its shareholders. One of the key questions this paper sought to explore
was whether or not an investor would sacrifice a portfolio performance in order to achieve a socially responsible
portfolio. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Scores from Bloomberg and historical performance on
various securities in both the United States and Europe were collected in order to construct various portfolios.
For some portfolios, the returns were adjusted based on ESG Scores in order for companies with better ESG
scores to receive more weight when portfolio optimization techniques were applied. In addition, given that the
returns of companies with better ESG scores tended to have highly correlated returns, alternative portfolio
optimization techniques beyond the traditional Mean-Variance Optimization were used to enhance the portfolio
performance. Ultimately, it was shown that minimal difference existed between the returns of the ESG-weighted
portfolios and the non-weighted portfolios indicating an investor does not have to sacrifice financial performance
to achieve a socially responsible investment portfolio.
Focardi, S. M. and Fabozzi, F. J. (2020).“Climate change and asset management.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio
Management_ 46(3), pp. 95–107.


In this article, the authors explain how asset owners and asset managers should behave to cope with new
regulations and risks related to climate change. By optimizing portfolios with constraints on the global portfolio
carbon footprint, it is possible to construct equity portfolios and indexes with a low carbon footprint without
penalizing returns. In the future, there will be costs and opportunities as a result of the process of transitioning
to a low-carbon-emission economy. The authors explain how building future scenarios for assessing the climate
consequences of more- or less- stringent actions and regulations will be challenging because doing so requires
integrated assessment models that integrate climate science with economic data and predictions. According
to the authors, bond investors offer more promise in forcing corporations to adopt policies to reduce carbon
emissions than do equity investors by affecting funding costs. This can be done through carbon emission reduction
covenants in corporate bond indentures and carbon policy performance bonds; the latter can be used to control
government performance as well as corporate performance. On the financing side, green bonds can be used to
fund carbon emission reduction projects.
Fridson, M., Jiang, L., Mei, Z., and Navaei, D. (2021).“ESG Impact on High-Yield Returns.” In: _The Journal of
Fixed Income_ 30(4), pp. 53–63.
High-yield bond investors who adopt an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) discipline must consider
the potential impact on returns. Recently introduced high-yield benchmarks for ESG-conscious portfolios make
it possible to quantify these effects. ESG-based high-yield indexes produced higher historical returns than a
standard high-index, but those differences are not statistically significant. The apparently superior downside
protection provided by ESG-oriented funds in down markets is explained by two major confounding factors:
the ESG-based indexes’ underweighting in Energy bonds and lowest-rated issues. High-yield investors cannot
reliably cushion their returns during selloffs by avoiding issuers involved in controversial weapons or with poor
scores in other ESG categories. Energy companies with good ESG scores show no tendency to provide or to
not provide superior downside protection in a high-yield bear market. The overall evidence to date on relative
performance confirms neither a bonus nor a penalty for adhering to ESG principles within a high-yield portfolio.
The growth of investing with attention to ESG factors has generated considerable controversy. Both proponents
and critics are keen to answer this question: Must ESG-conscious investors sacrifice return for the sake of their
principles, or do good ESG corporate citizens achieve higher profits with less risk, and actually outperform
standard indexes? We address this question by comparing the returns of recently introduced ESG high-yield
indexes and a standard index of the asset class.
Friederich, D., Kaack, L. H., Luccioni, A., and Steffen, B. (2021).“Automated Identification of Climate Risk
Disclosures in Annual Corporate Reports.” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
It is important for policymakers to understand which financial policies are effective in increasing climate risk
disclosure in corporate reporting. We use machine learning to automatically identify disclosures of five different
types of climate-related risks. For this purpose, we have created a dataset of over 120 manually-annotated annual
reports by European firms. Applying our approach to reporting of 337 firms over the last 20 years, we find that
risk disclosure is increasing. Disclosure of transition risks grows more dynamically than physical risks, and
there are marked differences across industries. Country-specific dynamics indicate that regulatory environments
potentially have an important role to play for increasing disclosure.

We look at a technique of classification, based on convergent and divergent patterns of returns that has been
applied to hedge funds and alternative investments, and apply it to US equity investment styles with a particular
interest in ESG. We extend the technique by looking at the impact of price changes on factor-mimicking portfolio
weights. This analysis leads to powerful insights into style return dynamics. In particular, an ESG-ranked long-
short portfolio looks more like momentum than value.
Garefalakis, A. and Dimitras, A. (2020).“Looking back and forging ahead: the weighting of ESG factors.” In: _Annals
of Operations Research_ 294, pp. 151–189.
The research for the investigation of the quality of the Corporate Annual Reports (CAR) and particularly the
part of the narrative information contained in it has long been underestimated, mainly due to the lack of tools
that allow an objective measurement and analysis of the narrative disclosed information of each company. The
concept of narrative portion is extremely difficult and multidimensional, most studies use ESG composite scores
to measure the CSP. The studies which investigate this issue are facing two major problems. The first problem
related with the aggregation number of Key Performance Indicators while the second problem is that all ESG
factors are not equal importance. This research focuses on the detailed presentation of a new method of reliable


measurement of the quality of the narrative part of the CARs, which is greatly enhanced by using two composite
indices, the unweighted index Ma.Co.I and the weighted one Ma.Co.Iw. These specific indices, for the first time,
offer a comprehensive and coded checklist (for the measurement of the quality of the narrative information)
which follows the guidelines set by the International Accounting Standards Board in 2010. Finally, this article
proposes a novel weighting scheme of narrative portion and suggest specific minimum and maximum weights
per ESG factors with purpose to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of composite scores and
to improve the quality of their outputs.
Garnier, J. (2022).“The Climate Extended Risk Model (CERM).” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
This paper is directed to the financial community and focuses on the financial risks associated with climate
change. It, specifically, addresses the estimate of climate risk embedded within a bank loan portfolio. During
the 21st century, man-made carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere will raise global temperatures, resulting
in severe and unpredictable physical damage across the globe. Another uncertainty associated with climate,
known as the energy transition risk, comes from the unpredictable pace of political and legal actions to limit
its impact. The Climate Extended Risk Model (CERM) adapts well known credit risk models. It proposes a
method to calculate incremental credit losses on a loan portfolio that are rooted into physical and transition risks.
The document provides detailed description of the model hypothesis and steps. This work was initiated by the
association Green RWA (Risk Weighted Assets). It was written in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Gaudemet,
Anne Gruz, and Olivier Vinciguerra (cerm@greenrwa.org), who contributed their financial and risk expertise,
taking care of its application to a pilot-portfolio. It extends the model proposed in a first white paper published
by Green RWAhttps://www.greenrwa.org/.
Gaussel, N. and Le Saint, L. (2021).“ESG Risk Rating of Alternative Portfolios.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Our aim is to propose a methodology to derive an ESG risk rating for any alternative portfolio, from the ESG
ratings of its constituents. To do so, we introduce the notion of ESG risk and define the ESG rating as the ratio
between the portfolio’s ESG risk and its total risk. We show how both ESG and total risk can be computed with
a variance-based formula. The empirical correlation matrix has to go through a prior shrinkage procedure to
ensure that the ESG risk cannot be larger than the total risk. An important consequence of our methodology is
that a fund trading an investment universe of poorly (resp. highly) ESG-rated instruments, should have a poor
(resp. good) ESG rating. We test this methodology on the Lyxor Epsilon Global Trend Fund and observe that
results are consistent with qualitative expectations.

mentation of impact investing.” In: _Journal of Financial Economics_ 142(2), pp. 697–718.
We draw on new data and theory to examine how private market contracts adapt to serve multiple goals,
particularly the social-benefit goals that impact funds add to their financial goals. Counter to the intuition from
multitasking models (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991), few impact funds tie compensation directly to impact,
and most retain traditional financial incentives. However, funds contract directly on impact in other ways and
adjust aspects of the contracts such as governance. In the cross-section of impact funds, those with higher profit
goals contract more tightly around both goals.

Review of Asset Pricing Studies_ 11(2), pp. 309–351.
We construct optimal portfolios of mutual funds whose objectives include socially responsible investment (SRI).
Comparing portfolios of these funds to those constructed from the broader fund universe reveals the cost of
imposing the SRI constraint on investors seeking the highest Sharpe ratio. This SRI cost crucially depends on
the investor’s views about asset pricing models and stock-picking skill by fund managers. To an investor who
strongly believes in the CAPM and rules out managerial skill, that is, a market index investor, the cost of the SRI
constraint is typically just a few basis points per month, measured in certainty-equivalent loss. To an investor
who still disallows skill but instead believes to some degree in pricing models that associate higher returns with
exposures to size, value, and momentum factors, the SRI constraint is much costlier, typically by at least 30
basis points per month. The SRI constraint imposes large costs on investors whose beliefs allow a substantial
amount of fund-manager skill, that is, investors who heavily rely on individual funds’ track records to predict
future performance.
Geczy, C. C. and Guerard, J. (2021).“ESG and Expected Returns on Equities: The Case of Environmental Ratings.”
In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Using long-standing models for expected returns of US equities, we show that firm environmental ratings interact
with those forecasted returns and produce excess returns both unconditionally and conditionally. Well-known


factor models subsume neither environmental-related return differentials nor expected return premia from those
scores and models. In addition, combining information from both inputs – expected return models and economic,
social, and governance (ESG) information – may provide an advantage in selecting investments. For financial
fiduciaries, this notion shifts the conversation about ESG reflecting only constraints to one of an expanded
information and possibly investment opportunity set.
Geczy, C. C., Guerard, J., and Samonov, M. (2019).“Efficient SRI / ESG portfolios.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Using an earnings forecasting model has been shown to be useful and highly statistically significant in U.S. stock
selection. We find that incorporation of ESG criteria can enhance stockholder returns holding risk constant
under reasonable assumptions. The novel approach here uses a normalization of ESG strengths and weaknesses
ratings, applied in both robust simply-weighted and realistic optimized portfolio settings. In part, it confirms a
now classical -cost result for certain SRI/ESG investment constraints and, with Diversity, Human Rights, and
Governance criteria, shows that SRI/ESG information can enhance portfolio returns. Thus, SRI/ESG investors
may not have to expect lower portfolio returns and Sharpe Ratios.
Gerard, B. (2018).“ESG and socially responsible investment: A critical review.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We review the literature on ESG and Socially Responsible Investment with a special focus on fixed income
investments. Most of the academic research is focused on the link between corporate CSR and ESG activities,
investors SR engagement and stock returns and firm value. Very few studies examine the link between firm ESG
policies and bond prices, risks and returns, and the performance of SR FI funds. The studies linking CSR to firm
value suggest that higher CSR leads to higher corporate value, higher equity returns and lower risk, enhancing
the general collateral value of the firm. The FI income studies provide mixed evidence about the link between
issuer ESG scores and bond prices and return characteristics: the bonds of issuers with both excellent and very
poor ESG behavior tend to under-perform the bonds of issuer with neither very strong or very poor ESG scores.
Lastly while issuers ESG excellence may have led to both their equity and debt outperforming those of poorer
ESG issuers in the 90, this out-performance halved in the first part of the 2000 and completely disappeared after
the financial crisis. Markets seem now to largely price ESG performance in equity and bond prices.
Gibson Brandon, R., Krueger, P., and Schmidt, P. S. (2021).“ESG Rating Disagreement and Stock Returns.” In:
_Financial Analysts Journal_ 77(4), pp. 104–127.
Using environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings from seven different data providers for a sample of
firms in the S&P 500 Index between 2010 and 2017, we studied the relationship between ESG rating disagreement
and stock returns. We found that stock returns are positively related to ESG rating disagreement, suggesting a
risk premium for firms with higher ESG rating disagreement. The relationship is primarily driven by disagreement
about the environmental dimension. We discuss the practical implications of our findings for firms’ equity cost
of capital as well as for investment managers and asset owners who use ESG investment strategies.
Gidwani, B. (2020).“Some Issues with Using ESG Ratings in an Investment Process.” In: _The Journal of Investing_
29(6), pp. 76–84.
A growing number of investors want to integrate information about company sustainability into their investment
decision processes to avoid risk, satisfy an asset owner’s needs, or find a new alpha-generating factor. Few new
users of environment, social, and governance (ESG) data understand how ESG ratings behave over time. We use
the CSRHub data set to show that ESG ratings regress strongly toward the mean. These ratings include both
data from most commercial ESG ratings firms and another 640 sources. The observed regression persists within
the ratings data across nine years, for a sample set of more than 8,000 companies. Newly-rated companies show
even more reversion than ”seasoned” companies. It is rare that a company maintains an especially high or low
ESG rating. Investors and company managers should both realize that ESG ratings are likely to change toward
the mean and that this pattern does not necessarily mean that a good company is getting worse or a bad one
is getting better.

In: _The Journal of Index Investing_ 10(2), pp. 24–42.
There has been a wide range of research in academia and the asset management industry about the financial
benefits of ESG investing. However, the equally important question about how to achieve consistency when
integrating ESG and what methodologies to use has not received the same level of attention. As a result, ESG
integration is often applied inconsistently and incompletely across portfolios. The authors provide a framework
for the integration of ESG into benchmarks at various strategic levels the top policy benchmark level to the
performance benchmark of individual allocations. In addition, they highlight the different investment objectives
that asset owners may pursue when integrating ESG and how they can reflect these in their choice of ESG


benchmarks. They find that integrating ESG into benchmarks makes sense as a framework to achieve consistency
because benchmarks are not only used at different strategic levels but also across all areas of asset management-
index-based, factor-based, and active management-to define the underlying investable universe and to provide
a yardstick for performance.

affects equity valuation, risk, and performance.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 45(5), pp. 69–83.
Many studies have focused on the relationship between companies with strong environmental, social, and gover-
nance (ESG) characteristics and corporate financial performance. However, these have often struggled to show
that positive correlations produced in fact explain the behavior. The authors of this article provide a link
between ESG information and the valuation and performance of companies, by examining three transmission
channels within a standard discounted cash flow model they call the cash-flow channel, the idiosyncratic risk
channel, and the valuation channel. They tested each of these transmission channels using MSCI ESG Ratings
data and financial variables. This showed that companies ESG information was transmitted to their valuation
and performance, both through their systematic risk profile (lower costs of capital and higher valuations) and
their idiosyncratic risk profile (higher profitability and lower exposures to tail risk). The research suggests that
changes in a company ESG characteristics may be a useful financial indicator. ESG ratings may also be suitable
for integration into policy benchmarks and financial analyses.

ESG Portfolios.” In: _The Journal of Index Investing_ 9(4), pp. 46–57.
There has been a wide range of research in academia and the asset management industry about the financial
benefits of ESG investing. However, the question of how to achieve consistency when integrating ESG has not
obtained the same level of attention. As a result, ESG integration currently is often applied inconsistently and
incompletely across asset owners portfolios. The authors of this article focus on how asset owners can implement
ESG integration through index-based allocations to portfolios that seek to replicate ESG indexes. Index-based
approaches offer consistency, transparency, and replicability and are generally cost-effective. Over a seven-year
study period, global and regional versions of the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes (as proxies for regional allocations)
resulted in significant variations in their respective ESG profiles and performance, but in all instances, there
was a clear reduction in all key risk measures.

and G by Time Horizon, Sector, and Weighting.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 47(3), pp. 94–111.
There are many ways to construct a company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) score or rating,
involving different combinations of financial and nonfinancial inputs. Determining the most influential criteria for
firm performance may be overlooked in the rush to ”do some ESG.” In this study, the authors deconstruct ESG
ratings performance at the E, S, and G pillar levels and use the most common key issues indicators that underlie
ESG scores. They find that the time horizon used has an important bearing on the indicators’ significance. In
the short term, they find that governance is the dominant pillar because it strongly reflects event risks, such as
fraud. In the long term, however, environmental and social indicators became more important because issues
such as carbon emissions tended to be more cumulative, presenting erosion risks to long-term performance. The
authors also find that a more balanced and industry-specific weighting of E, S, and G issues showed better
long-term relevance than the individual pillar indicators alone.

Climate-Transition Risks.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 47(9), pp. 35–53.
Countries have set varying targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal
of keeping the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees C. In this article, the authors
examine to what extent climate risk has been priced into equity markets and whether climate change can be
modeled using a typical risk model structure. They develop the fundamental economic transmission channels to
explain the potential impact of climate change on equity prices, including empirical evidence for climate policies
and green technology as financial risk drivers. They also study the impact of climate-transition risk on valuation
levels and trends. They conclude with a discussion of how to measure and categorize companies’ climate-risk
exposures and how to integrate climate-transition risks into risk models.
Giese, G., Ossen, A., and Bacon, S. (2016).“ESG as a performance factor for smart beta indexes.” In: _The Journal
of Index Investing_ 7(3), pp. 7–20.
Although traditional financial factors, such as value, growth, and momentum, have become common practice in
the construction of smart beta indexes, the question whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data


can be used as a performance factor in a similar way is a controversial topic in the asset management community.
In this article, the authors develop a methodology to extract an unbiased standalone ESG performance factor
from a broad database of ESG indicators and apply this ESG factor in different smart beta type of index
methodologies. The results show that this ESG factor can add financial value in portfolios and financial indexes
and can be used the same way as or in addition to traditional common performance factors.
Gorgen, M., Jacob, A., and Nerlinger, M. (2021).“Get Green or Die Trying? Carbon Risk Integration into Portfolio
Management.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 47(3), pp. 77–93.
Portfolio management is confronting climate change more strongly and rapidly than expected. Risks arising from
the transition from a brown, carbon-based to a green, low-carbon economy need to be integrated into portfolio
and risk management. The authors show how to quantify these carbon risks by using a capital markets-based
approach. Their measure of carbon risk, the carbon beta, can serve as an integral part of portfolio management
practices in a more comprehensive way than fundamental carbon risk measures. Apart from other studies, the
authors demonstrate that both green and brown stocks are risky per se, but there is no adequate remuneration in
the financial market. In addition, carbon risk exposure is correlated with exposures to other common risk factors.
This requires due diligence when integrating carbon risk in investment practices. By implementing carbon risk
screening and best-in-class approaches, the authors find that investors can gain a desired level of carbon risk
exposure, but this does not come without well-hidden costs.
Gougler, A. and Utz, S. (2020).“Factor exposures and diversification: Are sustainably screened portfolios any
different?” In: _Financial Markets and Portfolio Management_ 34, pp. 221–249.
We analyze the performance, risk, and diversification characteristics of global screened and best-in-class equity
portfolios constructed according to Inrate’s sustainability ratings. The financial performance of sustainably high-
rated portfolios is similar to the risk-adjusted market performance in terms of abnormal returns of a five-factor
market model. In contrast, low-rated portfolios exhibit negative abnormal returns. Firms with high sustainability
ratings show lower idiosyncratic risk and higher exposure toward the high-minus-low and the conservative-minus-
aggressive factor.

Examining the returns of 16 ESG indexes, we found evidence that a few violate the conditions of weak-form
efficiency and that all violate conditions for semi-strong form efficiency. Given previous research on market effi-
ciency in the ESG market, this points to profitable trading opportunities in this market using public information.
We also discuss why these results are not subject to previous criticisms of testing of market efficiency.

to E, S and G scores by the type of legislation. Non-Financial firms that manage environmental and governance

scores allowing them to hedge the negative effects of the announcements of fiscal policies during the pandemic.

In this article, the authors discuss a general method for ranking portfolios that places few limitations on the
portfolio constituents other than using publicly traded assets. The ranking scores reflect the expected reward
investors would require for accepting the risks of the portfolio in the context of an asset pricing framework.
The scores are computed through a factor model that acknowledges the factor return correlations. The authors
illustrate the approach with a large universe of exchange-traded funds assuming a linear model with Fama-
French-Carhart factors wherein factor premiums (i.e., expected returns) are proportional to factor volatilities.
The empirical analysis implies that the most significant factors from the Fama-French-Carhart factor set driving
the premiums are the market and the momentum factors.

_The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(1), pp. 47–65.
Investors throughout the world are increasingly interested in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.
However, they may be puzzled by the growing assortment of acronyms and terminology on the subject, leading to
challenges in determining what-if any – action they should take. ESG investing is an investment-related activity
that accounts for some type of ESG consideration. It is not a separate asset class, a single strategy, or even a
single type of action, and importantly, the appropriate approach is not the same for all investors. The authors


believe that specific forms of ESG investing can be prudent for investors with particular preferences, beliefs,
resources, and circumstances. As with any other form of investing, investors must establish their goals and weigh
the potential benefits of the various approaches against any relevant risks and costs to give themselves the best
chance of achieving their desired outcome. In this article, the authors clarify the terms and trends and provide
investors with an objective, practical framework for making informed decisions. Their four-step process helps
investors establish specific goals, evaluate potential options, and decide on an ESG investing approach based on
personalized criteria and trade-off considerations.

We contribute to the debate on whether using ESG/SRI criteria in investment decisions improves portfolio
performance. The choice of a specific ESG metric being crucial, we focus on the Net Environmental Contribution,
a robust open-source measure of environmental transition alignment. From a universe of 752 European stocks,
we select subsets of stocks with high and low NEC scores, and compare the performance of equal-weighted
and capitalization-weighted portfolios constructed from these subsets over the 2015-2020 period. The high-NEC
portfolios outperform the low-NEC ones consistently throughout the period, and particularly during 18 months
starting mid-2019, both before and during the COVID crisis.

We evaluate linear stochastic discount factor models using an ex-post portfolio metric: the realized out-of-
sample Sharpe ratio of mean-variance portfolios backed by alternative linear factor models. Using a sample of
monthly US portfolio returns spanning the period 1968-2016, we find evidence that multifactor linear models have
better empirical properties than the CAPM, not only when the cross-section of expected returns is evaluated in-
sample, but also when they are used to inform one-month ahead portfolio selection. When we compare portfolios
associated to multifactor models with mean-variance decisions implied by the single-factor CAPM, we document
statistically significant differences in Sharpe ratios of up to 10 percent. Linear multifactor models that provide
the best in-sample fit also yield the highest realized Sharpe ratios.

Waterloo.
The thesis is written in response to emerging issues brought about by an increasing number of assets allocated
in a portfolio and seeks answers to puzzling empirical findings in the portfolio management area. Over the years,
researchers and practitioners working in the portfolio optimization area have been concerned with estimation
errors in the first two moments of asset returns. The thesis comprises several related chapters on our statistical
inquiry into this subject. Chapter 1 of the thesis contains an introduction to what will be reported in the
remaining chapters. A few well-known covariance matrix estimation methods in the literature involve adjustment
of sample eigenvalues. Chapter 2 of the thesis examines the effects of sample eigenvalue adjustment on the out-
of-sample performance of a portfolio constructed from the sample covariance matrix.

We propose a ”1/N favorability index” to measure how favorable a market is to holding a 1/N portfolio. This
index reflects the extent of difficulty for an optimized portfolio to outperform the 1/N portfolio in a specific
market. A single-factor model predicts that bull markets are accompanied by a high 1/N favorability index and
vice versa. We validate the model implication that the 1/N portfolio is more difficult to beat in bull markets
using stock return datasets from a number of countries as well as the classic datasets used by DeMiguel et al.
(2009). Our results imply that the reported good performance of the 1/N portfolio in the US equity market can
be partially attributed to the long-run bullish trend in the market which gives rise to the high favorability of
the market to the 1/N portfolio.

Incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into systematic investments has drawn
numerous attention recently. In this paper, we focus on the ESG events in financial news flow and exploring the
predictive power of ESG related financial news on stock volatility. In particular, we develop a pipeline of ESG
news extraction, news representations, and Bayesian inference of deep learning models. Experimental evaluation
on real data and different markets demonstrates the superior predicting performance as well as the relation of
high volatility prediction to stocks with potential high risk and low return. It also shows the prospect of the
proposed pipeline as a flexible predicting framework for various textual data and target variables.


Gutterman, A. (2020).“Impact Investment Tools, Structures and Instruments.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This chapter described tools, structures and instruments used by impact investors to effectively apply their
theories of environmental and/or social change. Impact tools are actions that impact investors can take to
create a portfolio that is aligned with the investor’s investment and impact goals. Each impact investment needs
to be structured properly to optimize impact while fitting within the investor’s overarching impact investment
goals and policies. Impact structures are a function of decisions made regarding the investor, intermediary and
enterprise vehicles and the use of certain transactional tools that are intended to drive specific impact outcomes.
The selection of the investment instrument that will be used by the investor or the intermediary to provide
capital to the enterprise depends on a number of factors including the investment goals and risk tolerances
of the investor/intermediary; the legal structure of the enterprise; the instruments that the enterprise have
previously issued to other investors, since the relative priorities of different groups of investors with respect to
return of capital and their rights to the assets of the enterprise as collateral for their investment must always
be clear; the relative cost of the financing to the business and the existing owners; the risks associated with
the instrument and the degree of flexibility associated with any payment obligations under the terms of the
instrument.

from the S&P Global 1200.” In: _Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment_ , pp. 1–35.
Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) scores are frequently involved in investment-related
decision-making, e.g. for red-flagging or to manage risks. The increasing interest in ESG data raises the question
about their validity from various sources. Therefore, we explore the consistency and convergent validity of
the well recognized ESG data providers. Exploratory factor analysis of S&P Global 1200 index demonstrates
considerable uncertainty across extracted latent factors. Further factor analyses show that the consistency and
convergent validity across ESG data significantly depend on the industry type and the country of domicile. These
findings are supported by confirmatory factor analyses. Thus, the stakeholders are encouraged to incorporate
the company sector and domicile aspects into their decisions. Otherwise, naive use of primary ESG scores may
provide a misleading clue.

In: _Finance Research Letters_ , p. 102406.
Investors and regulators require reliable estimates of physical climate risks for decision-making. While assessing
these risks is challenging, several commercial data providers and academics have started to develop firm-level
physical risk scores. We compare six physical risk scores. We find a substantial divergence between these scores,
also among those based on similar methodologies. We show how this divergence could cause problems when
testing whether financial markets are pricing physical risks. Hence, financial markets may not adequately account
for the physical risk exposure of corporations using available risk scores. Finally, we identify key sources of
uncertainty for further investigation.

global markets.” MA thesis. Aalto University.
I study the relationship between CSR media publicity, measured by changes in companies’ ESG Con- troversies
Score, and medium- to long-term stock performance. Using a global dataset between 2004 and 2020, I find that
a portfolio of companies with improving ESG public image generates risk-adjusted excess returns of up to 0.4%
per month. However, betting against firms with deteriorating ESG public image overweighs the positive returns,
the effect being most notable in non-developed markets. The results are robust over time, but the performance
of low ESG performers seems to be driven by large firms whereas the opposite is found for high ESG performers.
In addition, I show that ”offsetting ESG”, meaning improving ESG performance as means of compensating for
past low performance, seems to be more valued than improving ESG performance overall.
Haley, M. R. (2017).“K-fold cross validation performance comparisons of six naive portfolio selection rules: how
naive can you be and still have successful out-of-sample portfolio performance?” In: _Annals of Finance_ 13,
pp. 341–353.
Recent research reports that optimal portfolio selection models often perform worse than equal-weight naive
diversification in out-of-sample testing. This paper extends this line of inquiry by comparing the out-of-sample
performance of the equal-weight naive strategy to the out-of-sample performance of five alternative naive strate-
gies, each of which derives from a simple heuristic that does not require any optimization. Out-of-sample portfolio
performance is assessed by mean, standard deviation, skewness, and Sharpe ratio; k-fold cross validation is used
as the out-of-sample testing mechanism. The results indicate that the proposed naive heuristic rules exhibit


strong out-of-sample performance, in most cases superior to the equal-weight naive strategy. These findings are
consequential for at least two reasons: first, if these simple heuristic-based rules outperform the equal-weight
naive strategy, then by transitivity they can outperform the mean-variance- and shortfall-optimal portfolio rules
that have been shown in the literature to be inferior to the equal-weight naive rule, which further emphasizes the
out-of-sample fragility of ”optimal”methods; and second, among naive diversification strategies, some appear
more robust in out-of-sample testing than others, hence the proposed methods may be useful when forming
mixed portfolio selection models wherein a naive strategy is combined with an optimal strategy to improve
performance.
Hambel, C., Kraft, H., and Ploeg, R. van der (2021).“Asset Pricing and Decarbonization: Diversification versus
Climate Action.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Asset pricing and climate policy are analyzed in a global economy where consumption goods are produced by
both a green and a carbon-intensive sector. We allow for two types of damages from global warming. Given that
the economy is initially heavily dependent on carbon-intensive capital, the desire to diversify assets complements
the attempt to mitigate economic damages from climate change. In the longer run, however, a trade-off between
diversification and climate action emerges. We derive the optimal carbon price, the equilibrium risk-free rate,
and risk premia. Climate disasters, which are more likely to occur sooner as temperature rises, significantly
increase risk premia on financial assets.

Strategy and ESG Level Factor Strategy. After we tested both of these strategies on our data, we concluded
factor strategies based on ESG scoring seem to be profitable during the last several years. Our findings confirm
the broader trend of recent outperformance of strategies based on ESG. Unexpectedly ESG level had better
performance than the ESG momentum. Performance of the momentum was positive, although low; compared to
the notable performance of ESG level. ESG scoring seems to be applicable to use in the portfolio as an addition
to other better-known factors. Nonetheless, we still recommend caution because of the inconsistency of the ESG
data among data providers.
Hanna, M. (2020).“The Impact of ESG-Related Industry Exclusions in Minimum-Volatility Portfolios.” In: _The
Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(2), pp. 87–103.
Can an investor combine minimum volatility and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing without
sacrificing the advantage of the low-volatility factor? Defensive and ESG investing are two of the fastest growing
segments in the investing world. This article seeks to determine whether defensive investors, through low-
volatility or minimum-volatility portfolios (MVPs), can maintain strong results if the portfolios include an ESG
industry restriction overlay. The implication of this study is that investors face no statistically significant loss
of investment return or increased risk by imposing ESG industry exclusions on minimum-volatility portfolios.
The author excludes 25 different sub-industries categorized as industries with environmental or social issues and
determines that the exclusions, individually and collective, do not cause any significant deviation in long-term
minimum-volatility investor experience. Ultimately ESG and minimum-volatility equity investors can have their
cake and eat it too. They can maintain a minimum-volatility experience while also improving the ESG profile
of their portfolio.
Harper, H. (2020).“One Institutional Investor Approach to Integrating ESG in the Investment Process.” In: _The
Journal of Portfolio Management_ 46(4), pp. 110–123.
This article intends to share one institutional investor approach to integrating environmental, social, and gover-
nance (ESG) factors in managing and overseeing the assets of the United Automobile Workers Retiree Medical
Benefits Trust. This approach takes a comprehensive view of material, ESG-related factors that influence cor-
porate financial results, which ultimately influence the investment performance of the Trust portfolio. Over
the past couple of decades, the number of investors integrating some form of responsible investing has grown
significantly. Nevertheless, a portion of the investment community still does not pursue ESG as part of the in-
vestment process. As with any decision in managing a pool of assets, one must be clear on governance structure,
investment beliefs, investment objectives, risk tolerances, regulatory environment, and other considerations in
designing an investment strategy. All of these important elements and dynamics are critical in designing and
implementing an investment policy and strategy that best fits the asset owner circumstances. Hopefully, by


sharing one investor perspective, this will prove useful for all investors as a data point for considering the role
and approach of responsible investing in an investment program.
Harvey, C. R., Liu, Y., and Saretto, A. (2020).“An Evaluation of Alternative Multiple Testing Methods for Finance
Applications.” In: _The Review of Asset Pricing Studies_ 10(2), pp. 199–248.
In almost every area of empirical finance, researchers confront multiple tests. One high-profile example is the
identification of outperforming investment managers, many of whom beat their benchmarks purely by luck.
Multiple testing methods are designed to control for luck. Factor selection is another glaring case in which
multiple tests are performed, but numerous other applications do not receive as much attention. One important
example is a simple regression model testing five variables. In this case, because five variables are tried, a t-
statistic of 2.0 is not enough to establish significance. Our paper provides a guide to various multiple testing
methods and details a number of applications. We provide simulation evidence on the relative performance of
different methods across a variety of testing environments. The goal of our paper is to provide a menu that
researchers can choose from to improve inference in financial economics.
Hays, M. and McCabe, J. (2021).“Sustainable and Impact Investing: A Taxonomy of Approaches and Considerations
for Fiduciaries.” In: _The Journal of Wealth Management_ 24(2), pp. 10–24.
The application of sustainable and impact investing approaches to the management of investment portfolios
has risen dramatically over the past three years due to a convergence of factors, including increased cross-
generational interest and the enhanced ability of asset managers to utilize these approaches when seeking strong
risk-adjusted returns. But two key challenges hold many asset owners and managers back from taking action: 1)
confusion over the differences among the vast array of sustainable and impact investing disciplines and 2) lack of
clarity on whether and how investors who serve in a fiduciary capacity can incorporate these disciplines. In this
article, the authors introduce a taxonomy of sustainable and impact investing approaches, mapped to a set of
guidelines for fiduciaries to consider in practice. This framework, based on a mix of market, legal, academic, and
internal risk/return research, provides investors with guidance on applicability by ESG approach by account
type, ranging from investment management accounts (both nondiscretionary and discretionary) to revocable
and irrevocable trusts, to ERISA accounts. The sustainable and impact investing industry is at an inflection
point where further growth will need to be supported by clear and well-supported frameworks-and this article
serves to provide them.
Heeb, F., Kolbel, J., Paetzold, F., and Zeisberger, S. (2022).“Do Investors Care About Impact?” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We assess how investors’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainable investments responds to the impact of those
investments, using a framed field experiment. Although investors have a substantial WTP for sustainable invest-
ments, they do not pay more for investments with more impact. This also holds for dedicated impact investors.
When investors compare several sustainable investments, their WTP increases with impact, but depends strongly
on the choice set. Investors experience positive emotions when choosing a sustainable investment, irrespective of
the investment’s impact. These findings suggest that the WTP for sustainable investments is driven by ”warm
glow” and not by deliberate evaluations of impact.
Henriksson, R., Livnat, J., Pfeifer, P., and Stumpp, M. (2019).“Integrating ESG in portfolio construction.” In: _The
Journal of Portfolio Management_ 45(4), pp. 67–81.
In this article, the authors recommend an approach to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
issues into portfolios that is based on two premises. The first is that classification of firms as good or bad
ESG companies should be performed using ESG items that are material in that industry. The second premise
is that it is possible to overcome the sparse voluntary ESG data reported by firms by constructing an ESG
good minus bad (GMB) factor and then finding those firms whose returns load significantly on this factor.
The authors provide evidence that shows the superiority of using material, industry-specific ESG items and
the merits of expanding the ESG classification using the ESG GMB loadings. Their approach is particularly
suitable for quantitative investment approaches that invest in portfolios with large number of positions and
many small active exposures, wherein vendor ESG data can be used in portfolio construction efficiently without
the need to employ detailed ESG analyses of many individual firms. With such portfolios, it is less about the
ESG classification of an individual company than about the aggregate portfolio tilt toward good ESG and away
from bad ESG at the portfolio level.
Hens, T., Schenk-Hoppe, K. R., and Woesthoff, M.-H. (2020).“Escaping the backtesting illusion.” In: _The Journal
of Portfolio Management_ 46(4), pp. 81–93.
Two tests can help asset managers to develop more robust investment strategies: an impact test and a survival
test. Both tests complement the backtest, in which one checks how a proposed investment strategy would have


performed in the past. The impact test considers the performance of the strategy when assets under management
grow (crowdedness), and it checks the impact that growth in assets under management in competing strategies
has on the proposed strategy (cross impact). The survival test considers the effect of the long-term evolution
of assets under management in competition for market capital. Using Shiller S&P 500 index and bond market
data, we show that time-series momentum (relative strength) performs best in the backtest and the impact test
but that an expected relative cash-flow rule (relative dividend yield) has the best long-term survival properties.
Hodges, P., Ren, H., Schwaiger, K., and Ang, A. (2022).“Net Zero Investing for Multi-Asset Portfolios seeking to
satisfy Paris Aligned Benchmark Requirements with Climate Alpha Signals.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
The authors embed Paris Aligned Benchmark (PAB) requirements in an illustrative multi-asset portfolio con-
taining developed and emerging market equities, sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, listed real estate, and com-
modities. By being PAB compliant, the immediate reduction and ongoing reductions in carbon emissions for
each asset class are designed to limit average global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees C, do not disinvest from
any sectors, and build in forward-looking data on emissions for issuers for both corporations and governments
with certain exclusions of poor climate performers. The authors show comparable performance in historical
data of the multi-asset PAB portfolio to a balanced multi-asset portfolio without climate considerations. The
outperformance is enhanced by alpha signals based on climate-related metrics and non-climate data.
Hsu, Y.-C., Lin, H.-W., and Vincent, K. (2017). _Do Cross-Sectional Stock Return Predictors Pass the Test without
Data-Snooping Bias?_ Tech. rep. Institute of Economics Academia Sinica.
This study examines the possible data-snooping bias as a competing explanation for the anomalies in the cross-
section of stock returns. We posit that the exhaustive standalone searches for profitable strategies could lead
to recommending spuriously predictive variables. In order to explore the severity of this problem, we use a
multiple testing method to evaluate the profitability of portfolios constructed by these predictors. Our empirical
analyses suggest that over half of the findings based on individual testing method are no longer statistically
significant after we adjust for data-snooping bias. Excluding the micro-cap stocks before portfolios construction
and applying the notion of economic significance in this study further weaken the evidence for predictability.

In: _Journal of Banking & Finance_ 97, pp. 257–269.
Using a series of advanced tests from White’s (2000) Check to correct for data-snooping bias, we assess the out-
of-sample performance of various portfolio strategies relative to the naive 1/N rule. When we analyze 16 basic
portfolio strategies, 126 learning strategies, and nearly 2,000 extended strategies, we find that some strategies
outperform the 1/N rule in conventional tests that do not account for data-snooping bias. However, after we use
the new tests that control for such bias, we find that none or very few of these strategies outperform the 1/N
rule. Thus, our finding underscores the necessity to control for data-snooping bias when making asset allocation
decisions.

Need.” In: _The Journal of Index Investing_ 9(2), pp. 18–26.
To maximize their effectiveness, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies should target those ESG
firms that are most capital constrained. Inherently, this involves seeking ESG firms that have irrationally high
costs of capital and thus high expected return. We replicate results that find returns among ESG firms that are
similar to those among non-ESG firms. In addition, we find that sorting stocks based on cost of equity capital
generates significant positive return for both ESG and non-ESG firms. Investing in an ESG in Need index, which
contains only high-ESG companies and tilts toward firms with high cost of capital, thus generates both higher
social value and better return than investing in traditional capitalization-weighted ESG indexes.
Huang, M. and Yu, S. (2020).“A new procedure for resampled portfolio with shrinkaged covariance matrix.” In:
_Journal of Applied Statistics_ 47(44), pp. 642–652.
Dealing with estimation error is an important issue when we implement the mean-variance paradigm for portfolio
construction. To tackle the problem, two approaches are proposed in literature, the portfolio resampling technique
introduced by Michuad and the well-known shrinkaged covariance matrix method. There are certain evidences on
the advantages of shrinkaged covariance over portfolio resampling, however, it is unclear whether a combination of
the two approaches could produce a better performance compared with using shrinkaged covariance alone. In this
paper, we propose a new algorithm to integrated linear or nonlinear shrinkage estimation with resampled portfolio
to achieve a further improvement. Our method are demonstrated via extensive simulation and application in
active portfolio management process.


Hubel, B. and Scholz, H. (2020).“Integrating sustainability risks in asset management: the role of ESG exposures
and ESG ratings.” In: _Journal of Asset Management_ 21, pp. 52–69.
The rising sustainability awareness among regulators, consumers and investors results in major sustainability
risks for firms. We construct three ESG risk factors (Environmental, Social, and Governance) to quantify the ESG
risk exposures of firms. Taking these factors into account significantly enhances the explanatory power of standard
asset pricing models. We find that portfolios with pronounced ESG risk exposures exhibit substantially higher
risks, but investors can compose portfolios with lower ESG risks without harming risk-adjusted performance.
Moreover, investors can measure the ESG risk exposures of all firms in their portfolios using only stock returns,
so that even stocks without qualitative ESG information can be easily considered in the management of ESG
risks. Indeed, strategically managing ESG risks may result in potential benefits for investors.
Husse, T. and Pippo, F. (2022).“Responsible Minus Irresponsible - a determinant of equity risk premia?” In: _Journal
of Sustainable Finance & Investment_ , pp. 1–23.
This study attempts to explain the relationship between ESG and financial performance. It utilises a new
method for constructing an ESG portfolio with a high exposure towards ESG that eliminates the inherent
correlation between size and ESG. In that perspective, a zero initial investment portfolio that goes long in
responsible companies and short in irresponsible companies is adopted; hence, developing a ’Responsible Minus
Irresponsible’ (RMI) factor mimicking portfolio. A pricing anomaly test on this portfolio suggests that ESG
exerts superior financial performance, mostly as a result of a significant lower market risk. Performing a cross-
sectional analysis of different factor models on an international set of company returns indicates a negative effect
of ESG on expected returns. However, the ESG factor becomes insignificant once multiple factors are introduced
as explanatory variables. Consequently, ESG represents a pricing anomaly but does not act as an independent
risk factor.
Hwang, I., Xu, S., and In, F. (2018).“Naive versus optimal diversification: Tail risk and performance.” In: _European
Journal of Operational Research_ 265(1), pp. 372–388.
It is well documented in portfolio optimization that naive diversification outperforms optimal mean-variance
diversification because the latter is subject to severe estimation error. Our study provides an alternative expla-
nation for the outperformance of naive diversification by examining the tail risk of naive diversification relative
to optimal mean-variance diversification. We utilize a rolling-sample approach and compare the out-of-sample
performance and tail risk of various optimal strategies to that of the naive diversification strategy. Using port-
folios consisting of individual stocks, we show that for portfolios containing relatively small number of stocks,
naive diversification outperforms optimal mean-variance diversification and is less exposed to tail risk. However,
for relatively large number of stocks in the portfolio, naive diversification maintains its superior performance but
increases tail risk and results in more concave portfolio returns. These results imply that the outperformance of
naive diversification acts as compensation for the increase in tail risk and concavity.

ability_ 12(22), p. 9351.
Smart beta strategy is an increasingly frequent approach to investment analysis for portfolio selection and
optimization and it can be combined with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. In order
to verify the impact of the integration between ESG and smart beta analysis, first we apply a portfolio rebalancing
based on ESG scores on securities selected according to different smart beta strategies (ex-post ESG rebalancing
approach). Secondly, we apply different smart beta approaches to sustainable portfolios, screened according to
the issuers’ ESG scores (ex-ante ESG screening approach). We find that ESG rebalancing and screening are
able to impact both on return and risk statistics, but with a different level of efficiency for each smart beta
strategy. ESG rebalancing proves to be particularly efficient when it is applied to a ”Value” portfolio. On the
other hand, when smart beta is applied to ESG-screened portfolios, ”Growth” is the strategy which shows the
highest increase in risk-adjusted performance, particularly in the US. Minimum volatility proves to be the most
efficient smart beta strategy for sustainable portfolios. In general, the increase in the level of sustainability does
not deteriorate the risk-adjusted performances of most smart beta strategies.

Elsevier. 430 pp.
The book explores the quantitative steps of a financial investment process. The authors study how these steps are
articulated in order to make any value creation, whatever the asset class, consistent and robust. The discussion
includes factors, portfolio allocation, statistical and economic backtesting, but also the influence of negative rates,
dynamical trading, state-space models, stylized facts, liquidity issues, or data biases. Besides the quantitative


concepts detailed here, the reader will find useful references to other works to develop an in-depth understanding
of an investment process.

_Journal of Asset Management_ 22, pp. 96–109.
We analyse the existence of a green bond premium and find a negative premium of 8 to 14 basis points. We are
further interested in the influence of ESG ratings on green bonds to determine if investors differentiate between
the shade of green. Examining a unique dataset of green bonds, we find a statistically significant influence of
ESG ratings on bond spreads. A one-point increase in the weighted average ESG score leads to a decrease in
the spread of 6 to 13 basis points. Interestingly, the results are not driven by the environmental friendliness of
the green bond issuer, but through the company’s governance.
Jacob, A. and Wilkens, M. (2021).“What drives sustainable indices? A framework for analyzing the sustainable
index landscape.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This article presents an encompassing four-step customizable framework for analyzing the heterogeneous sustain-
able index landscape. Compared to previous studies, we present means and methods to move the measurement
and impact of sustainability performance in the center of attention and emphasize the often neglected aim of
sustainable indices: incorporating sustainability into investment tools. Besides traditional comparisons of return
and risk indicators (step one), we analyze the sustainability profile of sustainable indices while actively manag-
ing the presence of ESG rating disagreement (step two). For the determination of index-specific return and risk
sources, we integrate sustainability factors in factor analyses and risk decomposition approaches (step three). A
performance attribution analysis based on sustainability classes increases the transparency on the composition
strategies of sustainable indices (step four). Our framework facilitates the analyses of sustainable investment
tools and thus supports investors in making more meaningful and forward-looking investment decisions in line
with their sustainability-related preferences.
Jacobsen, B., Cheng, E., and Lee, W. (2021).“Climate Change and Asset Allocation: A Distinction That Makes a
Difference.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 47(4), pp. 123–134.
It has become generally accepted that climate change affects economic variables such as growth and inflation.
Via these economic channels, it is likely that climate change will also affect asset returns and risks. The authors
provide evidence-based estimates of what these effects are and discuss how to incorporate climate change to
build portfolios that are robust to a variety of climate change scenarios.
Jacobsen, B., Lee, W., and Ma, C. (2019).“The alpha, beta, and sigma of ESG: better beta, additional alpha?” In:
_The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 45(6), pp. 6–15.
Rather than treat investments as statistical objects to be optimally combined into portfolios, investors are
increasingly interested in the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) dimensions of their in-
vestments. Analysts traditionally evaluated these dimensions in qualitative ways, but many data providers are
attempting to score these dimensions, effectively quantifying what was qualitative. For developed market equi-
ties, on the basis of one popular data provider ESG assessment, we evaluate the evidence on whether portfolios
of highly rated ESG stocks are materially different from their complements (non-ESG stocks) in their investment
opportunity sets. It is obvious that ESG stocks differ from non-ESG stocks in their ESG dimensions, but we
show that ESG stocks returns are also different. Although the total return-to-total risk of ESG stocks may be
lower than that for non-ESG stocks, after factor-adjusting the returns and risks, portfolios of ESG stocks with
positive alpha have return-to-risk features comparable to those of portfolios of non-ESG stocks with positive
alpha. For portfolios without statistically significant alpha, the portfolios of ESG stocks have lower residual
volatility than portfolios of non-ESG stocks. It should be possible, by factor-neutralizing portfolios, to build
better beta with comparable alpha portfolios by using ESG factors.
Jaeger, M., Krugel, S., Marinelli, D., Papenbrock, J., and Schwendner, P. (2020).“Understanding machine learning
for diversified portfolio construction by explainable AI.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
In this paper, we construct a pipeline to investigate heuristic diversification strategies in asset allocation. We
use machine learning concepts (”explainable AI”) to compare the robustness of different strategies and back
out implicit rules for decision making.In a first step, we augment the asset universe (the empirical dataset)
with a range of scenarios generated with a block bootstrap from the empirical dataset.Second, we backtest the
candidate strategies over a long period of time, checking their performance variability. Third, we use XGBoost
as a regression model to connect the difference between the measured performances between two strategies to
a pool of statistical features of the portfolio universe tailored to the investigated strategy. Finally, we employ
the concept of Shapley values to extract the relationships that the model could identify between the portfolio


characteristics and the statistical properties of the asset universe. We test this pipeline for studying risk-parity
strategies with a volatility target, and in particular, comparing the machine learning-driven Hierarchical Risk
Parity (HRP) to the classical Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) strategy.In the augmented dataset built from
a multi-asset investment universe of commodities, equities and fixed income futures, we find that HRP better
matches the volatility target, and shows better risk-adjusted performances. Finally, we train XGBoost to learn
the difference between the realized Calmar ratios of HRP and ERC and extract explanations.The explanations
provide fruitful ex-post indications of the connection between the statistical properties of the universe and
the strategy performance in the training set. For example, the model confirms that features addressing the
hierarchical properties of the universe are connected to the relative performance of HRP respect to ERC.
Jeffers, J., Lyu, T., and Posenau, K. (2021).“The Risk and Return of Impact Investing Funds.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We provide the first analysis of the risk exposure and consequent risk-adjusted performance of impact investing
funds, private market funds with dual financial and social goals. We introduce a new dataset of impact fund
cash flows constructed from financial statements. When accounting for market risk exposure, impact funds
underperform the market, though not more so that comparable private market strategies. We exploit known
distortions in measures of VC performance to characterize the risk profile of impact funds. Impact funds have
substantially lower market beta than VC funds, contradicting the idea of sustainability as a ”luxury good.” We
find that impact fund cash flows do not exhibit positive correlation with a public market sustainability factor,
consistent with the idea that private and public market sustainability strategies capture distinct exposures.
Jin, I. (2018).“Is ESG a systematic risk factor for US equity mutual funds?” In: _Journal of Sustainable Finance &
Investment_ 8(1), pp. 72–93.
On the outperformance of responsible investing (RI) which incorporates environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) into investment decisions, the empirical evidence to date is inconsistent from the viewpoint of ex-post
performance. This paper tries to explain the nature of return differential between RI and conventional investing
within the well-known risk-return paradigm. From the viewpoint of ex-ante equity risk premium, the five factor
model of Fama and French [2015. Five-factor Asset Pricing Model. Journal of Financial Economics 116: 1-22]
combined with a ESG-related factor applies to returns on 1,425 US open-end equity funds for the period from
April 2009 to December 2016. Empirical findings include that US open-end equity funds tend to hedge the
ESG-related systematic risk, and that the exposure to ESG-related systematic risk is significantly priced in the
market. The result implies that RI provides the downside protection against ESG-related systematic risk which
is not reduced even through extensive diversification.
Jin, I. (2021).“Systematic ESG Risk and Decision Criteria for Optimal Portfolio Selection.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
As institutional investors utilize passive ESG investing, ESG indices may account for joint movement in security
prices and act as systematic risk factors. We identify the ESG risk factor through the orthogonal spread between
a broad market and an ESG screened index. We suggest the double-index model and extended decision criteria for
optimal portfolio selection. Applying the decision criteria to US equity mutual funds shows that ESG integration
to portfolio optimization could enhance the portfolio’s ESG quality and marginally improve the portfolio’s
risk-adjusted return. We also suggest interpreting individual funds’ responsiveness to the ESG risk factor as
returns-based ESG scores.
Jondeau, E., Mojon, B., and da Silva, L. A. P. (2021).“Building Benchmarks Portfolios with Decreasing Carbon
Footprints.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
In this paper, we build portfolios with decreasing carbon footprint, which passive investors can use as new Paris-
consistent (PC) benchmarks and have the same risk- adjusted returns as business as usual (BAU) benchmarks.
As the distribution of firms’ carbon intensity is very skewed, excluding a small fraction of highly polluting firms
can massively reduce the carbon footprint of a portfolio of corporate stocks. We identify the worst polluters
globally, exclude them from the portfolio, and re- allocate the proceeds so as to keep sectoral and regional
exposures similar to those of the business as usual (BAU) benchmark. This approach limits divestment from
corporates in Emerging Countries that would result from implementing exclusions and reinvestment without the
objective of preserving regional exposures. We show that reducing the carbon footprint of the portfolio by 64%
in 10 years would be obtained by excluding sequentially up to 11% of the corporates, which together amount
to less than 6% of the global market portfolio. While this reallocation preserves regional and sectoral exposures
similar to those of the BAU benchmark, it does not change its risk-adjusted return. We define PC benchmark
portfolios at the global level, for Emerging Countries, Europe, North America, and the Pacific.
Juddoo, K., Malki, I., Mathew, S., and Sivaprasad, S. (2021).“An Investment Strategy Based on Impact.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.


Impact investing is based on using the ESG framework as a tool to evaluate firms that engage in generating
positive impact. Most impact investors and fund managers now integrate the ESG framework in their investment
and stock-picking process. However, due to lack of standardisation of ESG reporting, it remains a challenge for
investors and the public to identify the truly sustainable companies. We propose an additional measure of tax
avoidance to identify firms that are socially responsible. When firms indulge in excessive tax avoidance behaviour,
it may be viewed as unethical or socially irresponsible. We integrate the empirical association between corporate
social responsibility (CSR) and tax avoidance into an investment strategy based on impact. We adopt an
investment strategy based on firm level ESG ratings and tax avoidance practices. In a ’pure’ impact investment
strategy based on ESG and tax avoidance, we find that investing in high ESG rated firms and low tax avoidance
firms yield a buy and hold abnormal return of 2.6% per annum and 14.3% in a three-year investment horizon.
Next, if impact investors were to combine traditional investment strategies based on risk with impact measures,
we find that portfolios of high ESG and high price-to-book-ratio firms earn a buy and hold abnormal return
of 25.5%, while a portfolio of low tax avoidance and high price-to-book portfolios earn 33.1% in the long run.
Collectively, our results suggest that whilst impact investing do provide investors a return, it does not necessarily
outperform traditional investment strategies. Our results are robust to other risk factors and the sector of the
firm.
Kaiser, L. (2020).“ESG integration: value, growth and momentum.” In: _Journal of Asset Management_ 21(1), pp. 32–
51.
This study provides finer-grained results on the financial effectiveness of ESG integration for mainstream ac-
tive investment styles. We account for firm size, industry and country effects within ESG scores and introduce
the concept of ESG risk materiality. Empirical evidence shows that US and European investors can raise their
portfolio’s ESG level and increase risk-adjusted performance at the same time. Therefore, we add to the grow-
ing demand for sustainable products in the traditional investment industry and overcome the notion of ESG
integration being a burden to traditional investment strategies.
Kaiser, L. and Schaller, F. (2019).“Environmentally (Un-)Friendly Portfolio Construction.” In: _Journal of Invest-
ment Consulting_ 19(1), pp. 43–52.
This study sheds light on a new type of sustainable investment approach, namelyenvironmental, social, and
governance (ESG) momentum. We provide both a theoretical discussion and an empirical comparison of this new
approach and put it in perspective to traditional weighting schemes considered by sustainable portfolio managers.
In order to provide a clear basis for our argumentation and avoid any conflicting effects, we solely focus on the
environmental aspect of ESG ratings in Europe and pay particular attention to strategies’ carbon footprint as a
central measure of a portfolio’s environmental friendliness. Although the empirical results demonstrate inferior
environmental ratings for ESG-momentum portfolios and mixed results in respect to risk-adjusted returns across
alternative rating components, there might still be a case for investing in sustainable momentum stocks.
Kanuri, S. (2020).“Risk and Return Characteristics of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Equity ETFs.”
In: _The Journal of Index Investing_ 11(2), pp. 66–75.
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs attract investors who are driven by their personal values
in investing, but also by investors who believe that ESG investing will produce a favorable return-risk tradeoff.
This article looks at the risk and return characteristics of ESG ETFs since their inception (February 2005)
through July 2019 and compares them with investable proxies for US (Russell 3000 ETF-IWV) and global
(SPDR Global Dow ETF-DGT) equity markets. Using absolute and risk-adjusted performance measures, the
author finds that equal- and value-weighted ESG portfolios outperformed the IWV and DGT in some periods
and underperformed in others. However, during the entire period, IWV and DGT outperformed ESG portfolios
and had higher absolute- and risk-adjusted performance.
Kapri, T. (2021).“Implications of mutual funds’ ESG score on performance.” MA thesis. University of Vaasa.
There are conflicting economic theories on the implication of ESG criteria on fund perfor-mance. Previous
academic research has mostly mixed returns in portfolio level studies on the relationship of ESG and performance.
The mutual fund industry and ESG investing have both seen rapid growth in the recent years, increasing the
importance to better understand the effects of ESG profile of mutual funds. Therefore, this thesis investigates
impact of fund ESG ratings on the performance of the funds. The thesis uses ESG rating data from Morningstar
and factor data from Kenneth R. French’s database. The data sample of the thesis consist of US based equity
mutual funds that have received ESG rating from Morningstar between Jan-uary 1999 and October 2020. After
excluding duplicate funds and deploying best-in-class and worst-in-class approach on top and bottom 20% funds
based on Morningstar historic ESG rating, the sample consist of 326 mutual funds.


To investigate risk-adjusted returns of high and low ESG fund portfolios, the monthly returns of the portfolios
are analysed with the CAPM, Fama and French (1993) three-factor model, Fama and French (2015) five-factor
model and Fama and French (2018) six-factor model. Mul-tiple factor models are considered to minimize the
possibility of p-hacking which is argued by Revelli and Viviani (2015) to be one of the drivers of previous mixed
results in the SRI portfo-lio performance literature. Moreover, to investigate previous evidence and theory on
ESG implication during market downturns dummy variable depicting 10% of lowest market re-turns is introduced
to the factor models.
This thesis finds that low ESG rated funds have statistically significant negative abnormal re-turns during
1999 to 2020. The found significant negative abnormal return for the low ESG funds is monthly return of -
0.282% For the high ESG rated funds statistically significant ab-normal returns cannot be found. Moreover, this
thesis finds that high ESG funds outperform low ESG portfolios during the sample period. When introducing
market downturn dummy variables, the models find positive alphas for high ESG and low ESG fund portfolios.
However, the alphas are not statistically significant. Furthermore, the spread of high minus low ESG return with
the dummy variable is positive and not statistically significant.
Kaurissaari, M. (2021).“Markowitz Revisited: Is there trade-off between return and responsibility?” MA thesis.
University of Helsinki.
The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether investors face a trade-off between the responsibility and return
when they invest with interest in only one or the other. In addition, the research asks whether it is more worth
to invest in responsible funds, or can investors build their own portfolios and hence avoid the fund fees. The
thesis uses Standard Portfolio Theory to build portfolios, and the stocks are selected within Swedish Large Cap
companies. The first portfolio is built to maximize Sharpe ratio, that is the return-to-risk-ratio. Moreover, in
line with an older study, the model is extended to include preference for a responsible portfolio. The responsible
portfolio is called the Delta portfolio. Thus, the second portfolio is built by maximizing the portfolio’s ESG
score to its risk. A third portfolio is built with similar fashion to how funds are often constructed. The portfolio
includes only stocks with a minimum ESG score of 0.583 and then the stocks are picked by optimizing the
Sharpe ratio. The results show that by building a portfolio that only aims to maximize the responsibility to
risk ratio, the investor faces a decrease in risk but only a modest decrease in returns. Investors, who do not
care about responsibility, but optimize Sharpe ratio of portfolio face a decrease in ESG score, but the score
seemed to have been increasing since 2016. However, the increase in ESG score was associated with relatively
lower returns. Thus, Sharpe portfolio faced a more severe trade-off than the responsible portfolio. Moreover, the
ESG portfolio showed underperformance to the funds, in addition to lower ESG scores and higher risk. Delta
portfolio was found to be less risky and having relatively similar returns to funds. In conclusion, the results of
the study show that there is only a modest trade-off between responsibility and return for a responsible investor
but a more severe for conventional one. The study also shows a negative relationship between ESG score and
risk. Secondly, the results indicate that investors should not consider creating their own responsible portfolio
by following the screening for stocks and then using Sharpe ratio optimization, but instead try maximizing the
Delta ratio, or invest in a well rated ESG-fund.
Kaustia, M. and Yu, W. (2021).“Greenwashing in Mutual Funds.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This paper investigates mutual funds’ potential ”greenwashing” behavior. Funds profiled as ESG- based receive
higher inflows compared to other similar funds. Importantly, we show this is true also for ESG labeled funds
having inferior objective ESG profiles, as based on Morningstar sustainability ratings, applying to both retail
and institutional funds. An analysis of mutual funds repurposing into ESG focus shows that fund families
especially tend to convert such funds whose ability to attract in-flows has been lagging behind. Documenting
and uncovering the motives for greenwashing is vital in terms of trust in the emerging and rapidly growing
market of green financial products, with high hopes for its pivotal role in combating climate change.
Kazak, E. and Pohlmeier, W. (2019).“Testing out-of-sample portfolio performance.” In: _International Journal of
Forecasting_ 35(2), pp. 540–554.
This paper studies the quality of portfolio performance tests based on out-of-sample returns. By disentangling
the components of the out-of-sample performance, we show that the observed differences are driven largely by
the differences in estimation risk. Our Monte Carlo study reveals that the puzzling empirical findings of inferior
performances of theoretically superior strategies result mainly from the low power of these tests. Thus, our results
provide an explanation as to why the null hypothesis of equal performance of the simple equally-weighted
portfolio compared to many theoretically-superior alternative strategies cannot be rejected in many out-of-
sample horse races. Our findings turn out to be robust with respect to different designs and the implementation


strategies of the tests. For the applied researcher, we provide some guidance as to how to cope with the problem
of low power. In particular, we make use of a novel pretest-based portfolio strategy to show how the information
regarding performance tests can be used optimally.
Kazak, E. and Pohlmeier, W. (2020). _Portfolio Pretesting with Machine Learning_. Tech. rep. University of Lancaster.
This paper exploits the idea of pretesting to choose between competing portfolio strategies. We propose an
estimator for a portfolio weight vector, which optimally trades off between Type I and Type II errors when
choosing the best investment strategy. Furthermore we accommodate the idea of bagging in the portfolio testing
problems, which helps to avoid sharp thresholding and reduces the amount of portfolio turnover. Our approach
borrows from both shrinkage and forecast combination literature. The portfolio weights of our strategy are
weighted averages of the portfolio weights from a set of stand-alone strategies. More specifically, the weights are
generated from a pseudo out-of-sample portfolio pretesting, such that they reflect the probability that a given
strategy will be overall best performing. Contrary to previous approaches, the shrinkage intensity is continuously
updated to incorporate the most recent information in the rolling window forecasting set-up. We show that the
bagged pretest estimator performs exceptionally well, especially when combined with adaptive smoothing. The
resulting strategy allows for a flexible and smooth switch between the underlying strategies and is shown to
outperform the corresponding stand-alone strategies.

Company Efficiency.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(2), pp. 25–56.
Characteristics of companies associated with climate change predict excess equity returns. This article shows
that companies with low-carbon-emission intensities-with carbon emissions being a key component of the Paris
Agreement-have high excess returns. The authors present evidence that companies with low carbon emissions
have high productivity and that low carbon intensities may reflect greater company efficiencies. A portfolio of
companies with a high proportion of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified buildings
also exhibits high excess returns. Such companies also contemporaneously exhibit high return on assets. Portfolios
constructed with carbon emission intensity and LEED-certified building signals are only weakly correlated with
a traditional quality factor. The authors further discuss how climate change-themed measures of company
efficiency may drive value for sustainably focused investors.

Nonfinancial performance measures, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) measures, are poten-
tially leading indicators of companies financial performance. In the study reported here, I drew on prior academic
literature and the concept of ESG materiality to develop new corporate governance and ESG metrics. The new
metrics predicted stock returns in a global investable universe over the tested period, which suggests potential
investment value in the ESG signals.
Kilmurray, D., Melin, L., and Mercereau, B. (2021).“Integrating Impact Funds into Mainstream Portfolios.” In:
_The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(4), pp. 103–119.
Interest in impact investing is growing, but investors typically allocate to impact funds and traditional assets
independently from one another. We develop an optimizer that brings both types of assets together. Doing so
allows investors to maximize impact for a certain level of risk-adjusted returns. For example, we find that investors
can allocate 18% more to impact funds on average while keeping risk-adjusted returns constant. Intuitively,
analyzing how impact funds and traditional assets interact should allow for better portfolio diversification. As
interest in impact investing broadens, tools integrating impact funds into mainstream finance should become
more widespread.
Klement, J. (2018).“Does ESG matter for asset allocation?” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
The integration of ESG factors into the investment process is increasingly becoming mainstream for institutional
investors. However, investors struggle with how to incorporate ESG criteria into their top-down asset allocation
decisions. In this report we show how ESG criteria can be systematically and consistently integrated into the
asset allocation process. Our approach can be used for almost any multi-asset portfolio without materially
reducing return expectations or increasing portfolio risk.
Krappel, T., Bogun, A., and Borth, D. (2021).“Heterogeneous Ensemble for ESG Ratings Prediction.” In: _arXiv
e-Print_.
Over the past years, topics ranging from climate change to human rights have seen increasing importance for
investment decisions. Hence, investors (asset managers and asset owners) who wanted to incorporate these
issues started to assess companies based on how they handle such topics. For this assessment, investors rely on


specialized rating agencies that issue ratings along the environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions.
Such ratings allow them to make investment decisions in favor of sustainability. However, rating agencies base
their analysis on subjective assessment of sustainability reports, not provided by every company. Furthermore,
due to human labor involved, rating agencies are currently facing the challenge to scale up the coverage in a timely
manner. In order to alleviate these challenges and contribute to the overall goal of supporting sustainability,
we propose a heterogeneous ensemble model to predict ESG ratings using fundamental data. This model is
based on feedforward neural network, CatBoost and XGBoost ensemble members. Given the public availability
of fundamental data, the proposed method would allow cost-efficient and scalable creation of initial ESG ratings
(also for companies without sustainability reporting). Using our approach we are able to explain 54% of the
variation in ratings R2 using fundamental data and outperform prior work in this area.

_The Review of Financial Studies_ 33(3), pp. 1067–1111.
According to our survey about climate risk perceptions, institutional investors believe climate risks have financial
implications for their portfolio firms and that these risks, particularly regulatory risks, already have begun
to materialize. Many of the investors, especially the long-term, larger, and ESG-oriented ones, consider risk
management and engagement, rather than divestment, to be the better approach for addressing climate risks.
Although surveyed investors believe that some equity valuations do not fully reflect climate risks, their perceived
overvaluations are not large.
Kumar, R. (2019).“ESG: Alpha or Duty?” In: _The Journal of Index Investing_ 9(4), pp. 58–66.
The paper examines information content of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) from factor exposure
perspective. We use integration approach of ESG in portfolio construction by using four broader MSCI USA
ESG indices. The analyses have been done using risk-return, CAPM, Fama-French three factors, Fama-French-
Carhart four factors, Fama-French five factors and Fama-French-Carhart six factors asset pricing models since
the inception of each of the four ESG indices. We find that most of the returns of these four indices are
explained by CAPM market factor and different asset pricing factors are significantly associated with returns of
these ESG indices. The analyses show that there is no information content in ESG overall score in constructing
a portfolio instead asset managers should incorporate relevant parameters forming part of overall ESG score in
their portfolio construction. The institutional investors should perform their duty of helping poorly ESG ranked
companies in changing their structural framework and thereby improving overall ESG score and then gaining
through ESG momentum.
Kumar, R. and Khasnis, A. (2020).“Fallen Angels with ESG Wings.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_
1(2), pp. 26–38.
This study examines the effect of environment, social, and governance (ESG) factors on fallen angel (FA) bonds,
which are rated investment grade at issue but are subsequently downgraded to high yield. FAs are characterized
by price pressure, higher yields, lower coupons, weaker covenants, higher probability of bankruptcy, higher
durations, and higher concentration in sectors subject to a recent specific shock as compared with investment-
grade bonds. The authors show the ESG-tilted FA portfolio negates some of the negative characteristics and
increases the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio. The authors also examine the effect of the separate components
of ESG’environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G)’separately on portfolio performance. They find that
the impact of a governance-tilted portfolio has better risk-adjusted return than the other two components
during the period of analysis. The conclusions are relevant for both active and passive institutional investors in
constructing investment-grade as well as high-yield strategies.
Kuntz, L.-C. (2018).“Portfolio Strategies with Classical and Alternative Benchmarks.” PhD thesis. Georg August
University of Gottingen.
This dissertation addresses different key elements in portfolio management. It intends to improve and analyze
influences on portfolio strategies and their performance. Likewise, it aims at the systematization and extension of
benchmark specifications as well as their effect on portfolio strategies. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect
of developing and implementing portfolio strategies. The dissertation seeks to contribute to the advancement of
portfolio strategies by making the performance generating process and influences on it more comprehensible and
transparent. In doing so, it attempts to strengthen the awareness of the impact of the exact design of portfolio
strategies and benchmarks on the resulting portfolio and its performance. The key findings of this dissertation
can be summarized as follows: The benchmark specification, especially in terms of the investible universe and the
inherent risk conception, has substantial influence on the explicit design and performance of portfolio strategies.
In general, the specification of the benchmark and design of portfolio strategies should be carefully considered


and the implementation should be well thought out. Alternative risk conceptions, such as regret risk, can be
applied to portfolio selection and lead to clearly different portfolio compositions. Moreover, timing strategies can
be improved by choosing a careful investment approach on the basis of distributional regressions. All empirical
work 3 of this thesis has in common that it pursues different ideas to set up portfolio strategies while explicitly
addressing the benchmark specification used for the implementation and evaluation of said strategies.
Lanza, A., Bernardini, E., and Faiella, I. (2020).“Mind the gap! Machine Learning, ESG Metrics and Sustainable
Investment.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This work proposes a novel approach for overcoming the current inconsistencies in ESG scores by using Machine
Learning (ML) techniques to identify those indicators that better contribute to the construction of efficient
portfolios. ML can achieve this result without needing a model-based methodology, typical of the modern
portfolio theory approaches. The ESG indicators identified by our approach show a discriminatory power that
also holds after accounting for the contribution of the style factors identified by the Fama-French five-factor model
and the macroeconomic factors of the BIRR model. The novelty of the paper is threefold: a) the large array of
ESG metrics analysed, b) the model-free methodology ensured by ML and c) the disentangling of the contribution
of ESG-specific metrics to the portfolio performance from both the traditional style and macroeconomic factors.
According to our results, more information content may be extracted from the available raw ESG data for
portfolio construction purposes and half of the ESG indicators identified using our approach are environmental.
Among the environmental indicators, some refer to companies’ exposure and ability to manage climate change
risk, namely the transition risk.
Le Guenedal, T. and Roncalli, T. (2022). _Portfolio Construction with Climate Risk Measures_. Tech. rep. Amundi
Asset Management.
Because of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the development of ESG investing and the emergence of net zero emission
policies, climate risk is certainly the most important topic and challenge for asset owners and managers now and
will remain so over the next five years. It considerably changes portfolio allocation and the investment framework
of both passive and active investors. The goal of this paper is to conduct a survey of the various climate risk
measures that are available in the asset management industry and the practices of portfolio construction that
use these metrics.
Therefore, the first part of this paper lists the different climate risk metrics - e.g., carbon footprint, carbon
transition pathway, carbon transition and physical risks. The second part is dedicated to portfolio optimization,
in particular portfolio decarbonization and portfolio alignment (Paris-based benchmarks and net zero carbon
objective). Among the different findings, two are of great importance for investors. First, portfolio decarboniza-
tion is more difficult when we include scope 3 carbon emissions. Indeed, optimizing using the sum of scopes 1, 2
and 3 emissions leads to a portfolio with more tracking error risk than using direct plus first tier indirect carbon
emissions. Second, portfolio alignment is more complex than portfolio decarbonization. Since aligning portfo-
lios with scope 3 is becoming the standard approach to climate portfolio construction, the impact on portfolio
management may be substantial, and the divergence between carbon investing and traditional investing will
increase.
Lee, L.-E. (2021).“What Does ESG Investing Really Mean? Implications for Investors of Separating Financial
Materiality and Social Objectives.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Interest in measuring companies’ behavior along economic, social, and governance (ESG) criteria reflects two
important objectives: social values and financial performance. Nevertheless, measuring these has been difficulty,
leading to confusion about ESG investing’s effectiveness. New data and analytical innovations have supported
efforts to separate material factors driving investment risk and return from those relevant primarily to social
objectives. This paper reviews evidence on the effectiveness of social value-based versus financially relevant
measures and identifies financially material factors, so as to guide pension fiduciaries and other investors on
using ESG factors to meet investment objectives.

Schemes.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(1), pp. 94–103.
How an overall rating is constructed can have a significant impact on its usefulness to investors. In this study,
we tested two approaches: equal weighting and backward optimization. Equally weighting E, S, and G pillar
scores across sectors showed less financial significance than the stand-alone G pillar score -that is, without E and
S scores - over the 13-year study period. Although backward optimization showed greater significance than the
stand-alone G scores, this approach may underestimate the importance of ESG indicators to financial results
over longer periods of time. These results suggest that investors seeking to combine E, S, and G into an aggregate


ESG score should proceed with caution. A naive approach such as equal weighting could introduce noise that
decreases financial significance and a backward-optimized approach may ignore the importance of different
time frames in how ESG risks unfold. Our findings illustrate the historical value in prospectively adjusting the
selection and weighting of ESG Key Issues industry by industry to capture companies’ exposure to dynamic and
emerging risks.

Recent Performance of ESG Investing, the COVID-19 Catalyst and the Biden Effect_. Tech. rep. Amundi Asset
Management.
This paper marks the latest update in our series exploring the impact of ESG investment on asset pricing in
stock markets. The previous papers, covering the periods 2010-2019, found that:
1) ESG investing tended to penalize both passive and active ESG investors between 2010 and 2013.
2) In contrast, ESG investing was a source of outperformance from 2014 to 2017 in Europe and North America,
and was even becoming a beta strategy in the Eurozone.
3) More recently the trends between North America and the Eurozone have somewhat diverged with ESG
performance in North America lagging the sustained advances made in the Eurozone.
4) In 2018-2019, a move became apparent from bestin-class selection policies to the implementation of more
active strategies to integrate a dynamic view of ESG scores.
5) The social pillar came to the fore in 2018-2019 after lagging from 2014-2017, likely due to growing concern
for social themes such as rising inequalities.
The purpose of this paper is to appraise recent ESG trends in global equity markets. It contributes to a broader
research project started at Amundi in 2014 on the relevance of ESG. Since the latest update in 2019, we have lived
through a global pandemic that profoundly reshaped the global economy and society, and an eventful change of
leadership in the United States. The aim of this paper is to analyze the changes in ESG trends since our latest
update in June 2019. We work on the North American and EMU universes and, for the first time in our research
series, also shed the light on Emerging Asia market. We identify that a presumed ”Biden effect”, assumed to
be supportive for ESG performance in North America, was actually anticipated earlier by investors and rooted
in the fertile ground of rising ESG awareness. This being said, Joe Biden’s election may have fueled some
momentum for the Emissions & Energy component of the Environmental pillar on both sides of the Atlantic
at the end of 2020. In addition, we previously showed that the Social pillar in North America had already
caught ESG investors’ attention following the market stress caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results
also demonstrate the Social pillar’s strong performance in North America since the end of 2020. Additionally,
we show that companies with better Governance have been the most resilient in terms of performance during
the pandemic’s troublesome market environment, independently of the region considered. In North America,
employing credit market data, we demonstrate that these firms also benefited from a lower corporate cost of
debt. In Emerging Asia, we have witnessed strong ESG performance since the end of 2020. Finally, employing
a predictive non-linear framework, our results support ESG as a serious candidate risk factor not only in the
EMU, but also in North America since 2019.

Stock Market.” In: _Economic Modelling_ 107, p. 105711.
The enhanced indexation constructs tracking portfolios to outperform the benchmark index without incurring
additional downside risk. Previous studies only consider optimizing the tracking portfolios return and risk
measures derived from historical price data. As environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics advance in
the capital markets, this paper quantifies the uncertainty behind ESG data and proposes a robust enhanced
indexation model with real-life constraints. Using ESG ratings from three of China’s mainstream raters over a
period 2015-2020, we conduct empirical studies to compare portfolios constructed by our model and previous
works. Numerical results demonstrate that embedding ESG in the enhanced indexation leads to higher returns
and lower risks. Moreover, the superiorities of the robust tracking portfolio are reducing the share of assets with
high ESG uncertainty and capturing the upward returns of ESG investment. Therefore, our tracking portfolio
is suitable for conservative and green investors who are suspicious of ESG data.
Lindeman, A. J. (2022).“ESG Score Design And Portfolio Construction.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG
Investing_ 2(3), pp. 42–60.


Many investors are striving to incorporate granular ESG data into their decision-making. The use of scores
themselves can be questioned-do they accurately reflect one’s views, or are too many decisions being delegated?
Or should one integrate ESG metrics directly into portfolio construction? We take the view of an index provider
serving various clients who are looking to systematize their views. The paper naturally has two arcs, the first
being score design from the ground up. The second part concerns the use of these scores (and sub-scores) in
portfolio construction, wherein both the investing hypothesis and practicalities of data availability are discussed.
We recommend that ESG portfolios be checked for unintended factor exposures, ESG metrics performance, as
well as traditional backtest measures. In order to focus on techniques, we limit the scope of data and companies
being included in this expository survey.
Lindsey, L. A., Pruitt, S., and Schiller, C. (2021).“The Cost of ESG Investing.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Even against increasing interest in socially responsible investing mandates, we find that implementing ESG
strategies can cost nothing. Modifying optimal portfolio weights to achieve an ESG-investing tilt negligibly affects
portfolio performance across a broad range of ESG measures and thresholds. This is because those ESG measures
do not provide information about future stock performance, either in relation to risk or mispricing, beyond what
is provided by other observable firm characteristics. That the stock market does not reflect significant equilibrium
pricing of ESG information is rationalized in a model of responsible investing wherein investors differ in which
ESG-related criteria are used to weight their portfolios.
Lioui, A. (2018).“ESG Factor Investing: Myth or Reality ?” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
When treated as a characteristic, there seems to be an ESG anomaly. A real time investor is better off when
augmenting an otherwise standard investment universe with two ESG portfolios of irresponsible and responsi-
ble firms. Out of sample, the optimal portfolio including the ESG portfolios outperforms one ignoring them.
This added value shows up in the last decade and ESG Factor is a nascent anomaly which became a reality
after the Great Financial Crisis. To harvest the ESG premium, the investor goes long irresponsible firms and
short responsible ones. In sample evidence based on a long sample fails to show any potential gain from ESG
investing. Moreover, long only investors with or without portfolio concentration constraints cannot harvest the
ESG premium. Small stocks magnify the potential gains from ESG Factor investing although big stocks already
deliver a respectable ESG diversification gain.
Lioui, A. and Tarelli, A. (2021).“Chasing The ESG Factor.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
In the time-series (ordinal ESG) or the cross-section (cardinal ESG)? We show analytically that, when proper
adjustment to guarantee identical ESG ratings is implemented, the return spread of the factors produced by the
two methods is merely noise. We provide a protocol to construct a cross-sectional ESG factor with a targeted
ESG rating without screening stocks, hence without harming ex ante diversification (Sharpe ratio). The cross-
sectional ESG factor neutralizes the exposure to other firm characteristics. Using ratings from several ESG data
vendors, we document strong variations in the ESG factor’s alpha in the time series and across data vendors.
The alpha filtered from realized returns is negatively related to the level of an ESG sentiment variable based on
media attention, while it is positively related to unexpected variations of the sentiment.
Lo, A. W. and Zhang, R. (2022).“Quantifying the Impact of Impact Investing.” In: _American Finance Association
Annual Meeting_.
We propose a quantitative framework for assessing the financial impact of any form of impact investing, in-
cluding socially responsible investing (SRI), environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives, and other
non-financial investment criteria. We derive conditions under which impact investing detracts from, improves on,
or is neutral to the performance of traditional mean-variance optimal portfolios, which depends on whether the
correlations between the impact factor and unobserved excess returns are negative, positive, or zero, respectively.
Using Treynor-Black portfolios to maximize the risk-adjusted returns of impact portfolios, we propose a quanti-
tative measure for the financial reward, or cost, of impact investing compared to passive index benchmarks. We
illustrate our approach with applications to biotech venture philanthropy, divesting from ”sin” stocks, investing
in ESG, and ”meme” stock rallies such as GameStop in 2021.

This chapter examines the use and merits of hierarchical clustering techniques in the context of multi-asset
multi-factor investing. In particular, it contrasts these techniques with several competing risk-based allocation
paradigms, such as 1/N, minimum-variance, standard risk parity and diversified risk parity. The chapter intro-
duces hierarchical risk parity (HRP) strategies based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and also introduces


hierarchical clustering based on the lower tail dependence coefficient. The chapter provides an overview of tradi-
tional risk-based allocation strategies and outlines a framework to measure and manage portfolio diversification.
It examines the performance of the introduced HRP strategies relative to the traditional alternatives. The chap-
ter discusses Meucci’s approach to managing diversification, which serves to construct a diversified risk parity
strategy based on economic factors.

In this report, we show that a standard set of variables would partially resolveinconsistencies and lack of uniform
standards among rating providers, which often confuses investors. Furthermore, we dissociate the impact of the
rating agencies’ different focus on E, S, or G from that of using non-standardized data. While the former, if
properly disclosed, can be useful as it allows investors to choose what rating will align more with their preferences,
the latter necessarily requires harmonization of the data.

Most discoveries in empirical finance are false, as a consequence of selection bias under multiple testing. Although
many researchers are aware of this problem, the solutions proposed in the literature tend to be complex and hard
to implement. In this article, the author reduces the problem of selection bias in the context of investment strategy
development to two sub-problems: determining the number of essentially independent trials and determining
the variance across those trials. The author explains what data researchers need to report to allow others to
evaluate the effect that multiple testing has had on reported performance. He applies his method to a real case
of strategy development and estimates the probability that a discovered strategy is false.

In this paper we address the problem of selection bias under multiple testing in the context of investment strate-
gies. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm that determines the number of effectively uncorrelated
trials carried out in the context of a discovery. This estimate is critical for computing the familywise false positive
probability, and for filtering out false investment strategies.

Climate change is a far-reaching, global phenomenon that will impact many aspects of our society, including
the global stock market dietz2016climate. In recent years, companies have increasingly been aiming to both
mitigate their environmental impact and adapt to the changing climate context. This is reported via increasingly
exhaustive reports, which cover many types of climate risks and exposures under the umbrella of Environmental,
Social, and Governance (ESG). However, given this abundance of data, sustainability analysts are obliged to
comb through hundreds of pages of reports in order to find relevant information. We leveraged recent progress in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a custom model, ClimateQA, which allows the analysis of financial
reports in order to identify climate-relevant sections based on a question answering approach. We present this
tool and the methodology that we used to develop it in the present article.

Data and Analysis.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
AI AND Fintech-powered ESG screening and analysis solutions have become ”strategic enablers” that can ad-
dress some of the inherent ESG information biases and potentially even ESG rating divergences arising from
corporate self-reporting, and annualised, backward looking reporting of information. Moreover, corporate dis-
closures can vary by region, with companies in developed economies in general disclosing more information than
companies in emerging economies. In such cases, the ”alternative data” is key to endeavour for capturing more
information from these ”black-box” companies for extra disclosures. Latest AI- and Fintech-led developments
and innovation-centred collaboration efforts between regulators, standards setters, assurance, and innovation
providers can provide a meaningful approach for ESG data complexity management.
Madhavan, A. and Sobczyk, A. (2020).“On the Factor Implications of Sustainable Investing in Fixed-Income Active
Funds .” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ , jpm.46.3.141.
Interest in sustainable investing in fixed income has grown tremendously. A natural question concerns how
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) attributes affect expected return and risk. Most evidence has
focused on equities. In this article, the authors use quarterly holdings data for a broad sample of US fixed-income
active mutual funds to attribute active returns to 1. the returns to static factor exposures; 2. time-varying factor
exposures; 3. security selection. They find that funds with strong ESG attributes derive a significant fraction of


their alpha from static factor exposures, which reflects a tilt toward higher-quality bonds that are less volatile.
This fact explains the strong negative relation between a fund total return and its holdings-based ESG score.
Madhavan, A., Sobczyk, A., and Ang, A. (2021).“Toward ESG Alpha: Analyzing ESG Exposures through a Factor
Lens.” In: _Financial Analysts Journal_ 77(1), pp. 69–88.
Using data on 1,312 active US equity mutual funds with 3.9 USD trillion in assets under management, we
analyzed the link between funds’ bottom-up, holdings-based environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores
and funds’ active returns, style factor loadings, and alphas. We found that funds with high ESG scores have
profiles of factor loadings that are different from those of low-scoring ESG funds. In particular, funds with high
environmental scores tend to have high quality and momentum factor loadings. In partitioning the ESG scores
into components that are related to factors and idiosyncratic components, we found strong positive relationships
between fund alphas and factor ESG scores.
Maiti, M. (2021).“Is ESG the succeeding risk factor?” In: _Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment_ 11(3),
pp. 199–213.
The present study addresses three questions: 1. Whether ESG is the succeeding risk factor? 2. To study the
relevance of each component of ESG in investment decision? 3. To develop a new more robust asset pricing
model with ESG. This study finds that three-factor models with market, size and ESG factors perform better
than the Fama-French three-factor model. Higher Sharpe ratios for ESG, environment, social and governance
factors indicate that portfolios formed on these factors show better investment performance over traditional
size and value-based portfolios for all cases. The main message of the study is that ESG, environment, social
and governance factors play an important role in predicting returns hence they should not be ignored while
considering investment decision.

efficiency.” In: _European Journal of Operational Research_ 290(3), pp. 1192–1206.
In this paper, we compare two of the main paradigms of portfolio theory: mean variance analysis and expected
utility. In particular, we show empirically that mean variance efficient portfolios are typically sub-optimal for
non satiable and risk averse investors. We illustrate that the second order stochastic dominance (SSD) efficient
set is the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem. We further show that the market portfolio is not
necessarily a solution to this optimization problem. We also conduct an empirical analysis, examining the ex
ante and ex post performance of SSD and mean variance efficient portfolios, using a bootstrap approach. In an
ex ante analysis, we compare empirical moments, the level of diversification and set distances of mean variance
and SSD efficient sets. We also show that the global minimum variance (GMV) portfolio and the part of the
mean variance efficient frontier (MVEF) composed of highly diversified portfolios is second order stochastically
dominated. This result also provides a possible alternative explanation for the diversification puzzle. Conducting
an ex post analysis, we construct second order stochastic dominating strategies that outperform the GMV
portfolio in terms of wealth and various other performance measures, producing a positive ex post opportunity
cost.

Margot, V., Geissler, C., Franco, C. D., and Monnier, B. (2021).“ESG Investments: Filtering versus Machine
Learning Approaches.” In: _Applied Economics and Finance_ 8(2), p. 1.
We designed a machine learning algorithm that identifies patterns between ESG profiles and financial per-
formances for companies in a large investment universe. The algorithm consists of regularly updated sets of
rules that map regions into the high-dimensional space of ESG features to excess return predictions. The final
aggregated predictions are transformed into scores which allow us to design simple strategies that screen the
investment universe for stocks with positive scores. By linking the ESG features with financial performances in a
non-linear way, our strategy based upon our machine learning algorithm turns out to be an efficient stock pick-
ing tool, which outperforms classic strategies that screen stocks according to their ESG ratings, as the popular
best-in-class approach. Our paper brings new ideas in the growing field of financial literature that investigates
the links between ESG behavior and the economy. We show indeed that there is clearly some form of alpha in
the ESG profile of a company, but that this alpha can be accessed only with powerful, non-linear techniques
such as machine learning.

Matos, P. (2020).“ESG and Responsible Institutional Investing Around the World: A Critical Review.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
This survey examines the vibrant academic literature on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing.
While there is no consensus on the exact list of ESG issues, responsible investors increasingly assess stocks in
their portfolios based on nonfinancial data on environmental impact (e.g., carbon emissions), social impact (e.g.,
employee satisfaction), and governance attributes (e.g., board structure). The objective is to reduce exposure to
investments that pose greater ESG risks or to influence companies to become more sustainable. One active area
of research at present involves assessing portfolio risk exposure to climate change. This literature review focuses
on institutional investors, which have grown in importance such that they have now become the largest holders of
shares in public companies globally. Historically, institutional investors tended to concentrate their ESG efforts
mostly on corporate governance (the ”G” in ESG). These efforts included seeking to eliminate provisions that
restrict shareholder rights and enhance managerial power, such as staggered boards, supermajority rules, golden
parachutes, and poison pills.
Mendiratta, R., Varsani, H. D., and Giese, G. (2021).“How ESG Affected Corporate Credit Risk and Performance.”
In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(2), pp. 101–116.
This article extends the authors’ research on how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics
have affected equity investing and corporate bonds. Unlike with equities-where MSCI’s previous research shows
that MSCI ESG Ratings had positive effects on stocks’ risk and return characteristics-the authors find that a
corporate bondholder’s main ESG focus could be mitigating downside risk, rather than capturing upside. They
also examine whether ESG added value beyond credit ratings-a significant point of interest for bondholders.
In short, ESG complemented credit ratings. ESG ratings had characteristics distinct from credit ratings and
delivered additional insights into risk and performance. ESG was in general more financially relevant in high-
yield (HY) bonds than in investment-grade (IG) bonds and more relevant in IG bonds with longer, rather than
shorter, maturities. Higher-ESG-rated issuers tended to have stronger cash flow metrics, lower levels of ex ante
risk, and less-frequent severe incidents than lower-rated-ESG issuers.
Mercereau, B. and Melin, L. (2020).“Optimizing Portfolios across Risk, Return, and Climate.” In: _The Journal of
Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(1), pp. 115–131.
Climate concerns have grown dramatically. Investment tools to fight climate change are still lacking, though. We
develop portfolio optimizers that minimize climate impact while maximizing expected returns and minimizing
risk. Global equity investors can lower their portfolio’s climate alignment temperature to 2.5 deg C without
hurting its Sharpe ratio. Lowering its temperature further is more costly. Investors willing to forego 1pp in
expected returns to shave 1 deg C off their portfolio would invest in firms aligned with a sub 2 degC climate
scenario on average. Hence, investors factoring climate alignment in would benefit ”colder” assets and hurt
”hotter” ones. In practice, asset allocators could use three-dimensional optimizers to design the best risk, return,
and climate impact trade-off for each client. Being able to diversify across asset classes means that the trade-off
between risk-adjusted returns and climate alignment is moderate.

p. 1842.
This study focuses on assets related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are the most recent
aspect of the Socially Responsible Investment framework and have caught the attention of investors due to their
investment opportunities as well as the global challenges that can be achieved. The profitability of developing an
investment strategy is shown based on the value of the alphas obtained from the estimation of the Fama-French
five-factor model when compared to an equally weighted portfolio, even when transaction costs are taken into
consideration. In addition, it is proven that investors should focus their investments on two main SDGs: Good
health and well-being (Goal 3) and Industry, innovation and infrastructure (Goal 9).

on factor-based investment strategies.” In: _Risk Management_ 23(3), pp. 213–242.
Studies show that companies with a strong Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) profile are more com-
petitive than their peers, as they use resources, human capital and innovation more efficiently. High ESG-rated
companies have lower exposure to systematic risk factors and low expected cost of capital, leading to higher
valuations in a DCF model framework. They are typically more transparent, particularly with respect to their


risk exposures, risk management and governance standards and have better long-term vision. The paper finds
that higher Alpha can be harvested by restricting investment exposure to the ESG theme combined with various
style characteristics, as they display low systematic and idiosyncratic tail risks. It shows that an ESG overlay on
such factor-based strategies, particularly on ’multi-factor’, ’value’ and ’low volatility’ in that order, reduces both
systematic and idiosyncratic risks further. ESG overlay on ’quality’ factor provides the highest return among
ESG target indices, however, the underlying ’quality’ factor provides even higher excess return. These findings
can provide some insight on return enhancement to investors investing in the global equity markets.

Our work aims to develop a stand-alone trading system to construct portfolios that show the benefits of value
and momentum style integration and presents the effectiveness of alternative integration methods for long-only
absolute return funds, which seeks absolute returns that are not highly correlated to traditional assets such
as stocks and bonds. Our approach uses the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
model to guide the necessary steps, processes, and workflows for executing our project.

In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 2(2), pp. 117–136.
This article seeks to tilt traditional macro trend-following strategies toward countries with high Environmental,
Social, and Governance (ESG) scores. The integration incorporates both ESG levels and changes (improvements
or deteriorations in sustainability). Notably, the authors find that the international ESG exposure of the macro
portfolios can be substantially increased without any cost in performance for both long-only and long-short
portfolios. In some cases, transaction cost-adjusted Sharpe ratios can even benefit from a minor shift toward
more ESG exposure.

Research Letters_ 44 (102073), p. 102073.
We introduce a factor approach to performance measurement of global ESG equity investments. We construct
ESG pure factor portfolios (PFP) following Fama-MacBeth; then, applying Fama-French (FF) spanning re-
gressions that simultaneously test performance and the validity of adding new ESG factors to the FF 5-factor
model. To address endogeneity, we use a GMM-IV estimator. Our ESG portfolios do not generate significant
alphas during 2015-2019, corroborating the literature’s neutrality argument. We find no sufficient evidence for
ESG factors to complement FF5. PFPs, nevertheless, may serve as ESG indices to quantify investment portfolio
sustainability risks via performance attribution of the ESG factor tilt.

Strategies.” In: _The Journal of Investing_ 25(2), pp. 113–124.
Do institutional investors sacrifice risk-adjusted returns by incorporating environmental, social, and corporate
governance (ESG) considerations? The authors analyze two relatively hightracking-error global strategies con-
structed using ESG data-a tilt strategy and a momentum strategy and find that both model portfolios outper-
formed the MSCI World Index over the past eight years, while also improving the ESG profile of the portfolios.
These backtested model portfolios provide an example of how institutional investors with the tolerance to take
some active risk, while at the same time looking to improve the ESG profile of their portfolios on a systematic
basis, can incorporate such strategies in their investment processes.
Nofsinger, J. R. and Varma, A. (2021).“Keeping Promises? Carbon Risk Disclosure and Mutual Fund Portfolios.”
In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Morningstar’s disclosure of carbon risk (CR) scores in May 2018 showed that (environmentally) sustainable
mutual funds in the US had lower CR scores before the disclosure and a greater reduction in their portfolio
CR scores after the announcement relative to convention funds. The observed causal impact of disclosures is
consistent with funds’ primary investment objectives. Conventional funds that are signatories to UN’s Principles
for Responsible Investment (PRI) or those with secondary sustainability mandates behave more like other con-
ventional funds rather than sustainable funds. Such funds appear insensitive to disclosures as their sustainability
considerations are superseded by other primary investment criteria. Sustainable funds lower their CR score by
reducing exposure to fossil fuels, not by increasing exposure to renewables.
Nugent, T., Stelea, N., and Leidner, J. L. (2020).“Detecting ESG topics using domain-specific language models
and data augmentation approaches.” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
Despite recent advances in deep learning-based language modelling, many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks in the financial domain remain challenging due to the paucity of appropriately labelled data. Other issues


that can limit task performance are differences in word distribution between the general corpora - typically used
to pre-train language models - and financial corpora, which often exhibit specialized language and symbology.
Here, we investigate two approaches that may help to mitigate these issues. Firstly, we experiment with further
language model pre-training using large amounts of in-domain data from business and financial news. We then
apply augmentation approaches to increase the size of our dataset for model fine-tuning. We report our findings
on an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) controversies dataset and demonstrate that both approaches
are beneficial to accuracy in classification tasks.

an empirical analysis from Germany, France, Indonesia and Turkey.” In: _International Journal of Sustainable
Economy_ 13(1), p. 18.
This study aims to provide empirical insights into how sustainability (ESG) and broad-based indices are affected
by risk indicators such as VIX, CDS, and FX volatility index. Germany ESG-X, CDAX, France ESG-X, CAC All,
Indonesia SRI-KEHATI, IDX Composite, BIST (Borsa Istanbul) Sustainability, and BIST All price indices have
been examined. The daily data between November 4, 2014, and December 5, 2019 are used. Vector autoregression
(VAR), Granger causality and impulse response test are employed in the analysis. The results of the study
revealed that companies which are included in the Germany ESG-X, France ESG-X, and SRI-KEHATI are
affected by shocks less than the companies included in broad-based indices of each country. In contrast to this
result, BIST Sustainability is affected more by the shocks than BIST All. Stocks with higher ESG exposure in
terms of quantity, quality, and credibility tend to have a lower risk. Causality test results revealed that VIX
causes broad-based and ESG indices more than any other risk indicators.
Oikonomou, I., Platanakis, E., and Sutcliffe, C. (2017).“Socially Responsible Investment Portfolios: Does the
Optimization Process Matter?” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This study investigates the impact of the choice of optimization technique when constructing Socially Responsible
Investment (SRI) portfolios. Corporate Social Performance (CSP) scores are price sensitive information that
is subject to considerable estimation risk. Therefore, uncertainty in the input parameters is greater for SRI
portfolios than conventional portfolios, and this affects the selection of the appropriate optimization method.
We form SRI portfolios based on six different approaches and compare their performance along the dimensions
of risk, risk-return trade-off, diversification and stability. Our results for SRI portfolios contradict those of the
conventional portfolio optimization literature. We find that the more ”formal” optimization approaches (Black-
Litterman, Markowitz and robust estimation) lead to SRI portfolios that are both less risky and have superior
risk-return trade-offs than do more simplistic approaches; although they also have more unstable asset allocations
and lower diversification. Our conclusions are robust to a series of tests, including the use of different estimation
windows and stricter screening criteria.
Ouchen, A. (2021).“Is the ESG portfolio less turbulent than a market benchmark portfolio?” In: _Risk Management_
24, pp. 1–33.
Given that there is no consensus on the fact that ESG portfolios are characterized by very high returns and very
low risks compared to conventional portfolios, this study aims to empirically verify whether the series of returns
of an ESG portfolio is less volatile than the returns of a benchmark market portfolio. To verify this hypothesis,
we used the Markov-switching GARCH models in order to model the process of the series of daily returns of
the ESG portfolio ”MSCI USA ESG Select,” as well as those of the market benchmark portfolio daily returns
series ”S&P 500,” during the period June 01, 2005 to December 31, 2020 as well as that excluding the COVID19
crisis and from June 1, 2005 to October 29, 2019. It can be concluded that the ESG portfolio ”MSCI USA ESG
Select” is relatively less turbulent compared to the market benchmark portfolio ”S&P 500.”.
Oude Veldhuis, N. (2021).“Corporate Social Responsibility and the effect of ESG scores on stock returns.” MA
thesis. University of Groningen.
This study investigates whether the ESG score, as well as, the individual dimensions, i.e., environmental, social
and governance score, affect the stock returns. Based on a sample of 6514 firms from 23 developed countries
over the years 2002 to 2020, evidence suggests that ESG score does not affect stock returns. Moreover, at the
dimension-specific level, we can see that a portfolio of stocks with the highest governance scores achieves a
return of 40 basis points higher than their lowest counterpart. Meanwhile, a portfolio of stocks with the lowest
environmental scores achieves a higher return of 60 basis points than their highest counterpart. Lastly, evidence
suggests that the social score does not affect stock returns.

for Retirement.” In: _Sustainability_ 13(9), p. 5000.


We consider whether sustainable investment can deliver performance comparable to conventional investment in
investors’ long-term retirement plans. On the capital markets, sustainable investment can be achieved through
various instruments and strategies, one of them being investment in mutual funds that subscribe to ESG (envi-
ronmental, social, and governance) principles. First, we compare the investment performance of ESG funds with
matched conventional funds over the period 1994-2020, in Europe and the U.S. We find no significant evidence
of differing performance (at 5% level) despite using a number of investment performance metrics. Second, we
perform a historical backtest to model a UK personal retirement plan from 2000 till 2020, taking full account
of investment management fees and transaction costs. We find that investing in an index-tracker fund overlaid
with ESG screening delivers a pension which is 10.4% larger than is achieved if the index-tracker fund is used
without screening. This is also 20.2% larger than is achieved by investing in a collection of actively managed
funds with a sustainable purpose. We conclude that an ESG-screened long-term passive investment approach
for retirement plans is likely to be successful in satisfying the twin objectives of a secure retirement income and
of sustainability.
Pan, L. (2020).“Demystifying ESG investing considerations for institutional cash investors.” In: _The Journal of
Portfolio Management_ 46(3), pp. 153–156.
The popularity of responsible investing has extended to the fixed-income and liquidity-management fields in
recent years. Incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in cash investment decisions
makes sense as part of overall credit risk management. In addition to challenges related to disclosure, criteria,
measure, and verification, liquidity portfolios face unique challenges in the areas of relevance, concentration,
short-termism, and transparency. In this article, the author describes ESG considerations for institutional liq-
uidity investors and explains that rather than buying into a strategy with an ESG label, institutional liquidity
investors should engage their managers to include ESG issues in general credit evaluation and monitoring to
improve risk management.
Parker, F. J. (2021).“Achieving Goals While Making an Impact: Balancing Financial Goals with Impact Investing.”
In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(3), pp. 27–38.
For investors who wish to engage in impact investing and who have specific goals to achieve, there exists the
potential for a trade-off. When impact investments yield lower returns than nonimpact portfolios, how much
return should an investor be willing to give up to incorporate it? Using recent advances in goals-based utility
theory, this article explores an answer to that question and offers practical and concrete advice for advisors
to individual investors and fiduciaries of trusts. Using the goals-based framework, the author shows how an
investor’s willingness to sacrifice return for an impact investing mandate changes in response to market and
portfolio conditions.
Pastor, L., Stambaugh, R. F., and Taylor, L. A. (2021).“Dissecting Green Returns.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Green assets delivered high returns in recent years. This performance reflects unexpectedly strong increases
in environmental concerns, not high expected returns. German green bonds outperformed their higher-yielding
non-green twins as the “greenium” widened, and U.S. green stocks outperformed brown as climate concerns
strengthened. To show the latter, we construct a theoretically motivated green factor—a return spread be-
tween environmentally friendly and unfriendly stocks—and find that its positive performance disappears without
climate-concern shocks. A theory-driven two-factor model featuring the green factor explains much of the recent
underperformance of value stocks. Our evidence also suggests small stocks underreact to climate news.

_Journal of Financial Economics_ 142(2), pp. 572–597.
We propose a theory in which each stock’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) score plays two roles:
(1) providing information about firm fundamentals and (2) affecting investor preferences. The solution to the
investor’s portfolio problem is characterized by an ESG-efficient frontier, showing the highest attainable Sharpe
ratio for each ESG level. The corresponding portfolios satisfy four-fund separation. Equilibrium asset prices are
determined by an ESG-adjusted capital asset pricing model, showing when ESG raises or lowers the required
return. Combining several large data sets, we compute the empirical ESG-efficient frontier and show the costs and
benefits of responsible investing. Finally, we test our theory’s predictions using proxies for E (carbon emissions),
S, G, and overall ESG.

This study analyzes the tail-dependence between green bonds and other asset classes including energy markets,
stock markets, and conventional bonds. The study employs the cross- quantilogram method to identify the cross-


quantile dependence between green bonds and other assets. Our data set covers the U.S. and European asset
markets between October 2014 and February 2021. The empirical results show that the spillovers between asset
classes and green bonds vary widely across the quantiles, indicating that the hedging benefits of green bonds
against conventional asset classes differ across extreme and normal market conditions.

Crisis.” In: _Sustainability_ 13(23), p. 13253.
We investigated the financial performance of a sample of sustainable investment funds in terms of returns,
volatility, and contagion risk during the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to conduct a
more reliable analysis, we considered a homogenous sample composed of 30 funds declaring the same benchmark
(the MSCI Europe index). The Morningstar Sustainability ESG rating was used to determine the level of
sustainability of each fund. Both the GARCH models and the event study suggest that funds with a higher
ESG rating were able to outperform other funds during the COVID-19 period. These funds had a greater level
of resilience and exhibited a lower level of risk contagion during the pandemic. These instruments appear to
assume the role of risk protection and should be considered a means of both promoting sustainable growth and
minimizing portfolio risk.

equity funds.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 46(3), pp. 123–140.
The academic and practitioner literature provides a variety of contradicting theories as to expected consequences
of environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-related factors on the risk and return of equity securities. In light
of these heterogeneous expectations, this article sets out to empirically investigate the performance characteristics
of investable ESG equity funds to assess whether support for a particular direction in performance impact can
be found. The dataset comprises index and active equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds with a US
investment focus that indicate the use of ESG factors in their investment process and extends over a period
of 15 years (2004-2018). The empirical results are rather mixed. The authors find substantial cross-sectional
dispersion in performance among funds. After controlling for style factor exposures, the majority of funds in
any of the tested ESG categories does not produce statistically significant positive or negative gross alpha. An
industry-based performance contribution analysis reveals that systematic differences in allocations relative to
the broad market exist. However, their median contribution to performance is close to zero over time. Overall,
return and risk differences of ESG funds can be significant but appear to be mainly driven by fund-specific
criteria rather than by a homogeneous ESG factor. As a result, investors would be better served by assessing
investment implications on a fund-by-fund basis.

1/N for Stock Selection.” In: _European Journal of Operational Research_ 288(1), pp. 302–317.
For various organizational reasons, large investors typically split their portfolio decision into two stages - asset
allocation and stock selection. We hypothesise that mean-variance models are superior to equal weighting for
asset allocation, while the reverse applies for stock selection, as estimation errors are less of a problem for
mean-variance models when used for asset allocation than for stock selection. We confirm this hypothesis in
separate analyses of US and international equities using four different types of mean-variance model (Bayes-
Stein, Black-Litterman, Bayesian diffuse prior and Markowitz), a range of parameter settings, and a simulation
analysis calibrated to US data.

Bonds.” In: _The Journal of Fixed Income_ 26(1), pp. 21–41.
The authors study the historical relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and
corporate bond spread and performance, finding that corporate bonds with high composite ESG ratings have
slightly lower spreads, all else being equal. They also find that bonds with high ESG ratings have modestly
outperformed their lowerrated peers when controlling for various risk exposures. They provide details on the
effects of individual E, S, and G scores on performance. The outperformance of low-ESG issuers by their high-
ESG peers through the past eight years has not been accompanied by increasing relative valuation. This suggests
that the ESG performance gain is not a consequence of buying pressure and therefore might be retained.
Porage, C. (2021).“Sustainability in Portfolio Optimization.” MA thesis. Orebro University.
Sustainability has become a global trend due to the remarkable growth of the demand for sustainable practices
when controlling the risks associated with ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) aspects worldwide.
Hence, the socially responsible investors (or ESG investors) are curious to know whether investing in portfolios
containing sustainable assets would create better investment opportunities compared to the portfolios consisted


of both sustainable and nonsustainable assets. In this study, mean-variance spanning tests that are based on
classical optimal portfolio theory, are performed to examine whether there is a statistically significant difference
between the minimum variance frontier of sustainable stocks and the minimum variance frontier comprising
both the sustainable and non-sustainable stocks in OMXC25 index. For the analysis, weekly returns of fifteen
stocks of OMXC25 index are used over a three year period from 2017 to 2019. Statistically significant results
of the performed meanvariance spanning tests suggest that inclusion of unsustainable stocks will statistically
significantly improve the performance of the portfolio compared with a portfolio of sustainable stocks solely in
the OMXC25 index of the Danish capital market.
Pyles, M. K. (2020).“Examining Portfolios Created by Bloomberg ESG Scores: Is Disclosure an Alpha Factor?”
In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(2), pp. 39–52.
This article uses Bloomberg’s ESG disclosure data to create portfolios of high- and low-ESG firms over the recent
market run of 2011-2017. The primary purpose is to determine whether disclosure is an alpha factor related to
portfolio creation and management. We find that abnormal returns are generally higher for portfolios of lower-
scoring firms. The author further documents that larger firms, with lower profitability, and higher dividend
yields tend to have higher Bloomberg ESG disclosure scores. These variables also tend to inhibit market gains.
Further, once controlling for firm characteristics, the author finds no significant influence on buy-and-hold
abnormal returns from any of the ESG scoring variables. The results suggest positive screening based upon ESG
disclosure to be a non-value-enhancing strategy, while also recognizing the strong relationship between disclosure
and underlying firm characteristics that drive performance results.
Radovanov, B. and Marcikic, A. (2014).“Testing The Performance Of The Investment Portfolio Using Block Boot-
strap Method.” In: _Economic Themes_ 52(2).
The aim of this paper is to create a stable model of investment portfolio optimization through a high degree
of diversification and reduction of sudden changes in the allocation with monitoring of the dynamics of the
impact factor. In this sense, there is bootstrap application procedure, which, without an excessive number of
constraints involved in the optimization process provides solutions based on uncertain information. Thus defined,
the optimization method has been patented by Michaud (1999) entitled re-sampled efficiency. Accordingly, this
paper offers a comparison of the performance block bootstrap optimization models and traditional Markowitz’s
model inside and outside of the sample by applying the most frequently traded stocks on the BSE. The results
show a better performance out of the sample and the presence of a larger number of shares forming the portfolio
through bootstrap methodology. However, only through the traditional optimization process could be attained
optimum according to the required limits. Such effects can be observed by comparing the limits of efficiency
obtained through these optimization models. However, optimization-based methods bootstrap finds its place in
reducing errors of assessment resulting from the limited sample size.

The concept of portfolio alignment to a temperature trajectory has gained momentum among investors and
regulators since the 2015 Paris Agreement recognized the importance of the financial sector for the low carbon
energy transition. Yet, a clear definition and a transparent methodological framework for alignment assessment
with a temperature trajectory, or portfolio temperature alignment, are presently lacking and few academic studies
have addressed this question. This paper provides a definition of portfolio temperature alignment, reviews the
key methodological steps in computing alignment measures, and highlights the main scientific challenges, with
the aim to stimulate further research on this topic. We review, analyze and place in context the main findings
of the recent technical review of portfolio temperature alignment assessment methodologies by Institut Louis
Bachelier.

We present an approach to stress testing that is both practically implementable and solidly rooted in well-

to different settings. We show (i) how the consistency and continuity conditions are satisfied; (ii) how the result
of a scenario can be consistently cascaded from a small number of macrofinancial variables to the constituents
of a granular portfolio; and (iii) how an approximate but robust estimate of the likelihood of a given scenario
can be estimated. This is particularly important for regulatory and capital-adequacy applications.
Reboredo, J. C. and Otero, L. A. (2021).“Are investors aware of climate-related transition risks? Evidence from
mutual fund flows.” In: _Ecological Economics_ 189, p. 107148.


Using information on climate transition risks embedded in US equity mutual fund portfolios, we report evidence
that mutual fund investors consider climate-related transition risk to be an undesirable fund feature and ac-
cordingly allocate more money to funds with lower climate-related transition risk. The size of the impact of this
risk on fund flows differs depending on the performance expectations of investors and the socially responsible
focus and sustainability of the fund. Our results suggest that mutual fund investors are aware of climate-related
transition risks as evidenced by their investment decisions.
Roncalli, T., Le Guenedal, T., Lepetit, F., Roncalli, T., and Sekine, T. (2020).“Measuring and Managing Carbon
Risk in Investment Portfolios.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This article studies the impact of carbon risk on stock pricing. To address this, we consider the seminal approach
of Gorgen et al. (2019), who proposed estimating the carbon financial risk of equities by their carbon beta. To
achieve this, the primary task is to develop a brown-minus-green (or BMG) risk factor, similar to Fama and
French (1992). Secondly, we must estimate the carbon beta using a multi-factor model. While Gorgen et al.
(2019) considered that the carbon beta is constant, we propose a time-varying estimation model to assess the
dynamics of the carbon risk. Moreover, we test several specifications of the BMG factor to understand which
climate change-related dimensions are priced in by the stock market. In the second part of the article, we
focus on the carbon risk management of investment portfolios. First, we analyze how carbon risk impacts the
construction of a minimum variance portfolio. As the goal of this portfolio is to reduce unrewarded financial risks
of an investment, incorporating the carbon risk into this approach fulfills this objective. Second, we propose a
new framework for building enhanced index portfolios with a lower exposure to carbon risk than capitalization-
weighted stock indices. Finally, we explore how carbon sensitivities can improve the robustness of factor investing
portfolios.

Rubbaniy, G., Khalid, A. A., Ali, S., and Naveed, M. (2021).“Are ESG Stocks Safe-Haven during COVID-19?” In:
_SSRN e-Print_.
This study contributes to the debate on safe-haven characteristics of environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) stocks during COVID-19 pandemic. Using wavelet coherence framework on four major ESG stock indices
from global and emerging stock markets, and two proxies of COVID-19 fear over the period from February 5th,
2020, to March 18th, 2021, we find a strong and positive co-movement between health fear index of COVID-19
and returns on ESG stocks suggesting the existence of safe-haven properties in ESG stocks. However, we also
observe a negative co-movement between stock market base proxy of COVID-19 and returns on ESG indices,
suggesting that safe-haven properties of ESG stocks are contingent upon the proxy of COVID-19 pandemic. Our
findings are of particular interest for the investors and asset managers who may use ESG stocks to diversify
their portfolios during health crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic.
Ruf, B. M., Das, N., Chatterjee, S., and Sunder, A. (2019).“Investments in ESG-Rated Mutual Funds: Is Good
Better than Great?” In: _The Journal of Wealth Management_ 22(1), pp. 49–55.
Socially responsible mandated mutual funds are a popular class of funds characterized by strategies that address
sustainability, responsibility, and impact. The dramatic growth of socially responsible mandated mutual funds
during the last decade, makes it important to understand how their social metrics (environmental, social and
governance; ESG) relates to their financial performance. The current study compares the risk-adjusted returns
of socially responsible mutual funds (SRMF) with funds rated by Morningstar Portfolio ESG Score grouped into
low, medium, and high ratings. We find that during the period of pre-recession boom, the funds with high-ESG
ratings had a significantly higher risk-adjusted performance than did funds with a low-ESG or mid-ESG rating.
This trend continued during the early parts of the Great Recession. During periods of economic recovery and
growth, SRMF rated low on ESG performed significantly better than highly rated SRMFs. For medium rated
SRMFs, other than prior to the Great Recession, fund performance was not consistently significantly different
from highly rated SRMFs.
Rzenik, A., Hanley, K. W., and Pelizzon, L. (2021).“The Salience of ESG Ratings for Stock Pricing: Evidence From
(Potentially) Confused Investors.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We exploit the a modification to Sustainanlytics’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating methodol-
ogy, which is subsequently adopted by Morningstar, to study whether ESG ratings are salient for stock pricing.
We show that the inversion of the rating scale but not new information leads some investors to make incorrect
assessments about the meaning of the change in ESG ratings. They buy (sell) stocks they misconceive as ESG
upgraded (downgraded) even when the opposite is true. This trading behavior exerts transitory price pressure
on affected stocks. Our paper highlights the importance of ESG ratings for investors and consequently for asset
prices.
Sahin, O., Bax, K., Czado, C., and Paterlini, S. (2022a).“ESGM: ESG scores and the Missing pillar.” In: _arXiv
e-Print_.


Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores measure companies’ performance concerning sustainability
and societal impact and are organized on three pillars: Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G). These
complementary non-financial ESG scores should provide information about the ESG performance and risks of
different companies. However, the extent of not yet published ESG information makes the reliability of ESG
scores questionable. To explicitly denote the not yet published information on ESG category scores, a new pillar,
the so-called Missing (M) pillar, is formulated. Environmental, Social, Governance, and Missing (ESGM) scores
are introduced to consider the potential release of new information in the future. Furthermore, an optimization
scheme is proposed to compute ESGM scores, linking them to the companies’ riskiness. By relying on the data
provided by Refinitiv, we show that the ESGM scores strengthen the companies’ risk relationship. These new
scores could benefit investors and practitioners as ESG exclusion strategies using only ESG scores might exclude
assets with a low score solely because of their missing information and not necessarily because of a low ESG
merit.
Sahin, O., Bax, K., Paterlini, S., and Czado, C. (2022b).“The pitfalls of (non-definitive) Environmental, Social,
and Governance scoring methodology.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Evaluating companies’ sustainability embraces environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities. Data
providers assign companies ESG scores as a quantitative measure based on available information. Refinitiv
(previously ASSET4) is a key data provider whose scores are used extensively by researchers. However, their
ESG scoring methodology allows the ESG scores of the five most recent years to change post-publication without
any announcements. Such ESG scores are called non-definitive. Then, ESG research findings using the data from
the same data provider might be inconsistent. By optimization and exploratory data-mining approaches, we show
that it is possible to change ESG scores to exhibit stronger risk dependence. Additionally, we discuss that the
initial disclosure of ESG information and an update in the published ESG information alter how ESG scores are
computed in a given industry group, impacting ESG research findings greatly. Finally, our work points out the
criticality that should be addressed to improve comparability within research studies relying on the same data
providers.
Sautner, Z. and Starks, L. T. (2021).“ESG and Downside Risks: Implications for Pension Funds.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Due to their long-term horizons, pension funds face enhanced exposures to the long-lived effects of many ESG
risks. Moreover, given the potential consequences of being underfunded, pension funds are particularly exposed
to ESG-related downside risks, especially those related to climate change. We discuss the implications of these
risks and provide evidence on institutional investors’ perspectives on climate-related downside risks and how
these risks are priced in financial markets. We also document how institutional investors address climate risks
in the investment process, with a focus on the role of engagement versus divestment.
Schanzenbach, M. M. and Sitkoff, R. H. (2021).“ESG Investing: Theory, Evidence, and Fiduciary Principles.” In:
_SSRN e-Print_.
Trustees and other investment fiduciaries of pensions, charities, and personal trusts, and those who advise them,
face increasing pressure to rely on ESG factors in the investment management of tens of trillions of dollars of other
people’s money. At the same time, however, confusion abounds about the intersection of fiduciary principles and
ESG investing. This article cuts through that confusion to provide guidance about when and how ESG investing
by trustees and investment fiduciaries is permissible. We make four interrelated points: (1) we provide a clarifying
taxonomy on the meaning of ESG investing, differentiating between risk-return ESG (i.e., using ESG factors to
improve risk-adjusted returns) and collateral benefits ESG (i.e., using ESG factors for third-party effects); (2) we
discuss the subjectivity inherent to identifying and applying ESG factors, which complicates assessment of ESG
investing strategies; (3) we summarize the current theory and evidence on whether ESG investing can improve
risk-adjusted returns, finding the results to be mixed and contextual; and (4) we show that American trust
fiduciary law generally prohibits collateral benefits ESG, but risk-return ESG can be permissible if supported
by a reasoned and documented analysis that is updated periodically.
Schmidt, A. B. (2020).“Optimal ESG portfolios: an example for the Dow Jones index.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Mean variance portfolio theory is expanded to accommodate investors preferences for the portfolio ESG value
(PESGV). Namely, PESGV is added to the minimizing objective function so that portfolio weights are simul-
taneously optimized in terms of returns, risk (volatility), and PESGV. PESGV is assumed proportional to the
sum of portfolio constituents weighted ESG scores and is controlled by the ESG strength parameter. A portfolio
formed with 29 constituents of the Dow Jones Index in 2015 - 2019 is considered as an example. The MSCI ESG
ratings are chosen for estimating PESGV. It is found that higher PESGVs yield more concentrated portfolios


and lower Sharpe ratios. Partial correlations based portfolios are more diversified and have higher PESGVs than
the Pearson correlations based portfolios.
Schmidt, A. B. (2021).“The ESG Conundrum: An Outsider’s View.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Two suggestions are offered to address growing criticism of the ESG-based investing. First, socially responsible
investors need to use portfolio performance measure that is explicitly sensitive to the portfolio ESG value. Second,
since the corporate ESG ratings are not regulated and are vaguely defined, the ratings agencies should provide
detailed information on how their ratings are calculated and allow their clients to implement the customized
ratings of their choice.
Schmidt, A. B. and Zhang, X. (2021).“Optimal ESG Portfolios: Which ESG Ratings to Use?” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
The idea behind the optimal ESG portfolio (OESGP) is to expand the mean variance theory by adding the
portfolio ESG value (PESGV) multiplied by the ESG strength parameter gamma (which is investor’s choice)
to the minimizing objective function (Pederson et al., 2019; Schmidt, 2020). PESGV is assumed to be the sum
of portfolio constituents’ weighted ESG ratings that are offered by several providers. In this work we analyze
the sensitivity of the OESGP based on the constituents of the Dow Jones Index to the ESG ratings provided
by MSCI, S&P Global, and Sustainalytics. We describe discrepancies among various ESG ratings for the same
securities and their effects on the OESGP performance. We found that the OESGP diversity decreases with
growing gamma. The dependence of the ESG tilted Sharpe ratio on gamma may have two maximums. The 1st
maximum exists at moderate values of gamma and yields a moderately diversified OESGP. The 2nd maximum
at large gamma corresponds to a highly concentrated OESGP. It appears if portfolio has one or two securities
with lucky combinations of high returns and high ESG ratings.
Schumann, E. (2019).“Backtesting.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We discuss the backtesting of investment and trading strategies. We start with the challenges and pitfalls:
overfitting, data preparation, and the effects of randomness. Then, we introduce and describe R software for
backtesting. We demonstrate how to use the software for univariate and multivariate strategies (i.e. portfolio
strategies) for two equity data sets. Specifically, we discuss the implementation and testing of momentum and
portfolio optimization models. Throughout, we stress the analysis of sensitivity and robustness checks. Since
such analyses require to run many backtests, we also discuss how backtests can be run in parallel.
Semet, R., Roncalli, T., and Stagnol, L. (2021).“ESG and Sovereign Risk: What is Priced in by the Bond Market
and Credit Rating Agencies?” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
In this paper, we examine the materiality of ESG on country creditworthiness from a credit risk and fundamental
analysis viewpoint. We first determine the ESG indicators that are most relevant when it comes to explaining the
sovereign bond yield, after controlling the effects of traditional fundamental variables such as economic strength
and credit rating. We also emphasize the major themes that are directly useful for investors when assessing the
country risk premium. At the global level, we notice that these themes mainly belong to the E and G pillars.
Those results confirm that extra-financial criteria are integrated into bond pricing. However, we also identify a
clear difference between high-and middle-income countries. Indeed, whereas the S pillar is lagging for the highest
income countries, it is nearly as important as the G pillar for the middle-income ones. Second, we determine
which ESG metrics are indirectly valuable for assessing a country’s solvency. More precisely, we attempt to infer
credit rating solely from extra-financial criteria, that is the ESG indicators that are priced in by credit rating
agencies. We find that there is no overlap between the set of indicators that predict credit ratings and those
that directly explain sovereign bond yields. The results also highlight the importance of the G and S pillars
when predicting credit ratings. The E pillar is lagging, suggesting that credit rating agencies are undermining
the impact of climate change and environmental topics on country creditworthiness. This is consistent with
the traditional view that social and governance issues are the main drivers of the sovereign risk, because they
are more specific and less global than environmental issues. Finally, taking these different results together, this
research shows that opposing extra-financial and fundamental analysis does not make a lot of sense.
Serafeim, G. (2020).“Public sentiment and the price of corporate sustainability.” In: _Financial Analysts Journal_
76(2), pp. 26–46.
Combining environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data with big data measuring public sentiment about
corporate sustainability performance, I found that the valuation premium for strong sustainability performance
increases as a function of positive momentum in public sentiment. An ESG factor long (short) on companies
with superior (inferior) sustainability performance and negative (positive) ESG sentiment momentum delivered
significant positive alpha. In contrast, the high-sentiment ESG factor delivered insignificant alpha and was
negatively correlated with the value factor. The evidence suggests that public sentiment influences investor


views about the value of sustainability activities and that big ESG data can be useful in identifying value ESG
stocks.
Serafeim, G. (2021).“ESG: Hyperboles and Reality.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
ESG has rapidly become a household name leading to both confusion about what it means and creating unre-
alistic expectations about its effects. In this paper, I draw on more than a decade of research to dispel several
myths about ESG and provide answers to important questions around theories of influence, the relation between
ESG and corporate value, and the usefulness of ESG assessments and ratings.
Seymour, A., Flint, E. J., and Chikurunhe, F. (2018).“Dynamic portfolio management strategies: A framework for
historical analysis.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
The performance of dynamic trading and investment strategies can be difficult to predict. Although not without
its problems, analysis of the historical performance of a strategy can provide valuable insight into its general risk
and return properties. Furthermore, historical analysis allows one to compare variations of a strategy and examine
the impact of various parameter choices and implementation rules. Dynamic strategy applications in three areas
are considered, namely derivatives, asset allocation and equity factor portfolios. Firstly, the analysis of a strategy
involving single-stock derivatives is examined in which call options on certain constituents of an index portfolio
are sold as an alternative method of under-weighting the underlying. Secondly, the historical performance of an
optimization-based asset allocation strategy is considered. The assumed aim of the strategy is to outperform a
benchmark of CPI 5 via dynamic trading in a portfolio of domestic equities, bonds, property and cash, as well as
international equities and bonds. Finally, the effects of portfolio construction on factor performance are studied
via an historical analysis in which portfolios corresponding to a selection of fundamental factors are managed
according to a range of weighting schemes, rebalance frequencies and portfolio sizes.
Shafer, M. and Szado, E. (2020).“Environmental, social, and governance practices and perceived tail risk.” In:
_Accounting & Finance_ 60(4), pp. 4195–4224.
Using the implied volatility smirk on individual equity securities to measure perceived tail risk, we find that
better environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices significantly reduce ex-ante expectations of a
left-tail event. Our findings are robust to using multiple model specifications and to adjusting for potential
endogeneity concerns. We also show that, while practices in each ESG pillar are important in reducing perceived
tail risk, the environmental pillar plays the most important role. Our results indicate that investors consider
strong ESG practices to be insurance against left-tail events rather than wasteful investment borne out of
managers’ own values or self-interest.
Shanaev, S. and Ghimire, B. (2021).“When ESG meets AAA: The effect of ESG rating changes on stock returns.”
In: _Finance Research Letters_ , p. 102302.
This study is the first to employ calendar-time portfolio methodology to investigate the impact of 748 ESG
rating changes on stock returns of US firms over 2016-2021. While ESG rating upgrades lead to positive yet
inconsistently significant abnormal returns of 0.5% per month, downgrades are detrimental to stock performance,
leading to statistically significant monthly risk-adjusted returns of -1.2% on average. These findings are more
pronounced for ESG leaders than laggards and are robust to various asset-pricing model specifications. The
effects of ESG rating levels are modest, with ESG laggards underperforming in risk-adjusted terms.
Shen, S., LaPlante, A., and Rubtsov, A. (2019).“Strategic asset allocation with climate change.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
We investigate the impact of climate change over a large universe of asset classes including stocks, bonds,
alternatives and a list of green assets which have low-carbon emission, in terms of their time-varying risk-return
trade-offs. We extend the strategic asset allocation framework of Hoevenaars et al. (2008) by adding the climate
risk as an additional state variable to the vector autoregression (VAR) model driving expected returns, beyond
the traditional macroeconomic variables. Green assets are in general resilient against temperature shocks, while
the others are negatively related to the risk of warming. The optimal portfolio weight on green assets is low,
due to the very high risk of green assets and an underestimated temperature projection implied by the VAR
model. We impose a temperature beta towards the return dynamics of each asset to correct the temperature
exposure on each asset class. We find that both temperature beta and short-selling constraint can help enhance
the demand for green assets, while their opportunity costs are much larger than the cost of ignoring green assets.
Sherwood, M. W. and Pollard, J. L. (2018).“The risk-adjusted return potential of integrating ESG strategies into
emerging market equities.” In: _Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment_ 8(1), pp. 26–44.
This study purposed to quantify the performance potential of integrating ESG research within emerging market
investment strategies, as well as the potential for risk diversification through investments in emerging markets.
This study evaluated literature on investing in both emerging markets and integrating environmental, social,


and governance (ESG) research-based strategies. This study examines real data on ESG and non-ESG inte-
grated emerging market indices, both region-specific and country-specific. This examination includes measuring
historical returns, beta, the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, the Conditional Value at Risk, skewness, and the
Omega ratio for ESG and non-ESG integrated emerging market indices. Paired t-test analysis is incorporated in
the measurement of the data. The results of the study indicate significant outperformance based on ESG inte-
gration. The implications of this study indicate that integrating ESG emerging market equities into institutional
portfolios could provide ...
Silva, A. F. A., Lôpo, R., and Lofiego, P. (2021).“ESG Integration Strategy for Stocks Portfolios Based on a
Resampling Methodology with a Multivariate Normal Distribution.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
The objective of this paper is to present a framework for ESG integration and analyze the consequences of
considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the optimization of investment portfolios.
We use a multivariate normal distribution of returns and we generate portfolios by an optimization process
combined with a Monte Carlo simulation,. After applying an ESG filtering strategy to portfolios, we show that
the ex-ante costs (optimization process) of the ESG integration strategy may be very low. The methodology
presented in this paper avoid complexity of some papers since it includes a new objective and it does not need
to optimize portfolios by modifying the utility function.

Sokolov, A., Caverly, K., Mostovoy, J., Fahoum, T., and Seco, L. (2021a).“Weak Supervision and Black-Litterman
for Automated ESG Portfolio Construction.” In: _The Journal of Financial Data Science_ 3(3), pp. 129–138.
The authors propose an approach that combines modern machine learning techniques in natural language pro-
cessing with portfolio optimization to incorporate views of companies’ environment, social, and governance
(ESG) performance. This is automatically done through curating and subsequently converting large-scale news
data into portfolio management decisions. They train a machine learning news data classifier to automatically
identify several key ESG issues in news data over time. They then aggregate these issues over time to gener-
ate a views vector under the Black-Litterman portfolio framework and finally compare the performance of an
ESG-tilted portfolio against a standard Black-Litterman portfolio. They also show how this can be achieved at
scale, in a fully automated manner, and with consistency over large periods of time. Their methodology thus
demonstrates a reasonable and agile method for asset managers to incorporate ESG considerations into their
portfolios free of any exclusionary frameworks and without sacrificing performance.
Sokolov, A., Mostovoy, J., Ding, J., and Seco, L. (2021b).“Building Machine Learning Systems for Automated ESG
Scoring.” In: _The Journal of Impact and ESG Investing_ 1(3), pp. 39–50.
Although investing in environment, social, and governance (ESG)-driven portfolios is already a large and growing
portion of global assets under management, applications of quantitative techniques to improve and standardize
ESG scoring and the construction of ESG portfolios are underutilized. In this article, the authors propose an
approach to automatically convert unstructured text data into ESG scores by using the latest advances in deep
learning for natural language processing (NLP). They also show how a state-of-the-art NLP technique, BERT,
can be incorporated to improve the accuracy of assessing relevance and content of documents in an ESG context
using social media data as an example and discuss the relevance of this approach to automating ESG scoring
and constructing ESG portfolios.
Sorensen, E., Chen, M., and Mussalli, G. (2021).“The Quantitative Approach for Sustainable Investing.” In: _The
Journal of Portfolio Management_ 47(8), pp. 38–49.
Sustainable (also known as environment, social, and governance [ESG]) investing is currently of intense interest
in the investment world. In this article, the authors consider the salient challenges associated with ESG investing
and how quantitative approaches may address them. Compared to fundamental methods of sustainable invest-
ing, the authors see quantitative methods as having several advantages: These methods can build on and extend
the vast analytical toolbox of modern portfolio theory to incorporate investor preference in portfolio construc-
tion; they can leverage the recent data explosion to obtain insights on many intangible sustainability metrics;
and they do not have the black box label. Instead, subjective judgement applied to building the quantitative
system is essential. A thoughtful analytical system can be applied to a large universe of stocks, and quantitative
methods may also be leveraged to predict popular ESG vendor ratings. Although it is in the early days of
quantitative sustainable investing, the authors believe these advantages will prove the quantitative method’s
worth in sustainable investing.


Statman, M. and Glushkov, D. (2016).“Classifying and Measuring the Performance of Socially Responsible Mutual
Funds .” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 42(2), pp. 140–151.
This article offers a factor model for classifying socially responsible mutual funds and measuring their perfor-
mance. The authors provide a factor model that consists of six factors: the four widely used factors of market,
smalllarge (SMB), value-growth (HML), and momentum, and two social responsibility factors, reflecting the
criteria most widely used by socially responsible funds. The first social responsibility factor is the top-bottom
factor (TMB), consisting of the difference between the returns of stocks of companies ranked in the top third
and the bottom third by five social responsibility criteria: employee relations, community relations, environ-
mental protection, diversity, and products. The second is the accepted-shunned factor (AMS), consisting of the
difference between the returns of stocks of companies commonly accepted by socially responsible investors and
the returns of stocks of companies they commonly shun. Shunned stocks are stocks of companies in the alcohol,
tobacco, gambling, firearms, military, and nuclear industries. A factor’s coefficient is its loading, tilt, or beta; the
authors use the term beta. TMB and AMS factors’ betas effectively capture the social responsibility features of
indices and mutual funds, and the TMB and AMS betas of indices and mutual funds generally reflect the social
responsibility scores of the companies whose stocks they contain. The classification of socially responsible mutual
funds by betas and contents differs from classification by Morningstar and other classifying services. Mutual
funds’ measured performance when the authors consider TMB and AMS factors differs from their measured
performance when these factors are overlooked.
Stotz, O. (2021).“Expected and realized returns on stocks with high- and low-ESG exposure.” In: _Journal of Asset
Management_ 22, pp. 133–150.
Empirically, stocks with a good environmental, social, or governance (ESG) rating tend to earn higher returns
than stocks with a low rating. In contrast, the expected returns of high-ESG stocks are primarily lower than
those of low-ESG stocks. The difference between realized and expected returns in the ESG domain constitutes
a puzzle which we will address in this paper. Applying a return decomposition, we find that the puzzle can be
explained by discount rate news. We find that discount rates of high-ESG stocks have fallen relative to low-ESG
stocks. However, discount rate news does not reflect changes in risk; rather, discount rate news is systematically
related to the demand of investors who have ESG preferences.
Suhonen, A., Lennkh, M., and Perez, F. (2017).“Quantifying Backtest Overfitting in Alternative Beta Strategies.”
In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 43 (2), pp. 90–104.
The authors investigate the biases in the backtested performance of ”alternative beta”strategies using a unique
sample of 215 trading strategies developed and promoted by global investment banks. Their results lend support
to the cautions in the recent literature regarding backtest overfitting and lack of robustness in trading strategy
performance during the ”live”period (out of sample). The authors report a median 73 percent deterioration
in Sharpe ratios between backtested and live performance periods for the strategies, and they establish a link
between performance deterioration and strategy complexity, with the realized reduction in live versus back-
tested Sharpe ratios of the most complex strategies exceeding those of the simplest ones by over 30 percentage
points. The robustness of strategy exposure to risk factors varies between asset classes and strategies; it appears
reasonable in equity volatility and FX carry strategies but quite weak in the equity value strategy in particular.
Swedroe, L. (2021a).“Do Wide Divergences in ESG Ratings Doom Investors?” In: _Advisor Perspectives_.
Six competing vendors rate how companies perform along environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.
But because those ratings differ widely across vendors, investors cannot reliably construct portfolios that meet
their personal criteria.
Swedroe, L. (2021b).“ESG Investing Means Lower Bond Yields.” In: _Advisor Perspectives_.
There has been an explosion in academic research on the impact of implementing environmental, social and
governance (ESG) on the risk and returns of equity portfolios. Research on fixed income, which has received less
attention, shows that positive ESG scores correlate with lower yield spreads, decreasing future returns for bond
investors.
Swedroe, L. (2021c).“Revisionist History in ESG Ratings.” In: _Advisor Perspectives_.
Investors following an environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandate can achieve their goals only if they
can accurately and consistently identify stocks that meet their criteria. But new research shows that those criteria
have been subject to arbitrary revisions and that there are wide discrepancies among the vendors providing the
data.

Swinkels, L. (2021).“Allocating to green bonds.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
Green bonds are about a decade old financial instrument with cash flows earmarked to improve the environment
or combat climate change. We show the spectacular growth of the asset class over time, but note that it is
currently still less than 1% of the entire fixed income market. The composition of the asset class has changed
considerably over time. At the start, it were mainly very safe supranational institutions issuing in a variety
of currencies with relatively short maturities. They were followed by corporates, especially utilities, and more
recently also governments have started issuing green bonds. This change of composition leads us to conclude
that historical data from before 2015 is less representative for the future. Our returns- and characteristics-based
analyses show that an investor allocating to green bonds should finance this from an aggregate fixed income
allocation to reduce the impact on the risk and return characteristics of the existing portfolio.
Taleb, W., Le Guenedal, T., Lepetit, F., Mortier, V., Sekine, T., and Stagnol, L. (2020).“Corporate ESG News
and The Stock Market.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
ESG investing’s popularity has continually increased in the past five years. ESG data is increasingly integrated
into investment processes. However, the information contained in ESG-related news for corporates has not been
entirely exploited by institutional and long-only investors. The objective of this paper is to identify the benefits
of ESG news information for active and factor-based investors. Indeed, one of the issues with ESG is the low
frequency of score updates. For active management, we analyze ESG-sorted portfolios in investment universes
filtered by ESG news volume. Metrics of ESG-related news are sourced from Truvalue Labs, a provider of
Artificial Intelligence-powered ESG insights and analytics. We find that the approach of a universe focused on
ESG news of corporates has been efficient in the early 2010s on the lower ESG-ranked side of the universe, but
also on the higher ESG rank. More recently, it has positively contributed to more dynamic approaches of ESG
investing. Finally, increasing the sensitivity to the highly visible SDGs significantly improves the return of ESG
long-short portfolios.

about it?” In: _Quantitative Finance_ 21(11), pp. 1855–1868.
It is widely noted that market capitalisation weighted portfolios are inefficient and underperform an equal
weighted portfolio over the long-term. However, at least since 2016, an equal weighted portfolio of stocks in
the S&P500 has significantly underperformed the market capitalisation weighted portfolio. In this paper, we
analyse this underperformance using stochastic portfolio theory. We show that the equal weighted portfolio
does appear to outperform the market capitalisation weighted portfolio over the long-term but with periods of
significant short-term underperformance. In addition, we find that concentration in the market capitalisation
weighted portfolio has increased in recent years and has contributed to the recent underperformance together
with a significantly lower level of diversification benefits. Furthermore, we highlight an approach to improve the
performance of a portfolio by dynamically selecting a market cap or an equal weighting using a rudimentary
linear regression model.
Tang, D. Y., Yan, J., and Yao, Y. (2021).“The Determinants of ESG Ratings: Rater Ownership Matters.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings are increasingly popular in financial markets and for policy
making. We show that firms held by the same investors who own the rater (”sister firms”) receive higher ESG
ratings. Exogenously created sister firms through acquisitions provide causal inference for the ownership effect.
Sister firms receive higher ratings when the common owners have larger stakes in the ESG rater. Notwithstanding
their initial higher ratings, sister firms have poorer future ESG outcomes. These findings suggest that the quality
of ESG ratings can be undermined by conflicts of interest and have important implications for practitioners and
regulators.
Tayali, S. T. (2020).“A novel backtesting methodology for clustering in mean–variance portfolio optimization.” In:
_Knowledge-Based Systems_ 209, p. 106454.
The decisions of asset selection and allocation lie at the heart of financial portfolio management. For these
challenging tasks, the mathematical programming model of the mean-variance optimization problem proposes
to use the concept of diversification. The novel methodology in this article is a representation of the accumulated
knowledge of this model from the modern portfolio theory. It is a practical application for portfolio managers
to help synthesize the available historical data and to infer rational decisions. The state-of-the-art backtesting
methodology integrates the unsupervised machine learning method of clustering analysis into the mean-variance


portfolio optimization model. The test results from the proposed novel methodology show that clustering with
Euclidean distance measures outperform the results of the benchmark and other specified clustering methods
for different datasets, backtesting periods, and temporal scales of major stock indices.
Terpstra, M. (2021).“ESG ratings and stock performance: Do high ESG portfolios perform differently within and
between industries?” MA thesis. University of Groningen.
In this study, I investigate whether twenty industry portfolios consisting of the best ESG performers within
an industry perform differently compared to the industry and other industries by estimating the alpha in the
Fama French 5-factor model. In the main model, I find that the ESG portfolio performs significantly worse
than the industry within two industries. However, after considering different criteria, I only find a significantly
negative alpha in the Healthcare Services industry. Furthermore, two industry portfolios perform significantly
different from the market ESG portfolio in the main regression. Nevertheless, this finding is not consistent when
different criteria are considered. Therefore, in specific situations the relative ESG performance and industry can
be considered for investment decisions. However, given the size of the alphas, the effect on performance will be
marginal.
Tharavanij, P. (2021).“ESG Rating and Financial Performance: A Review Article.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This paper provides the updated reviews on the relationships between a firm’s ESG (Environmental, Social and
Governance) performance and its financial performance. The survey includes both theories and empirical studies.
It addresses three main issues. Firstly, it investigates relationships between ESG and financial performance.
Secondly, it examines the effect of firm’s ESG performance on its cost of equity. The effect of each component
(E/S/G) is studied. Thirdly, it investigates the effect of ESG performance on a firm’s value. Based on a standard
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, value creation could come from the cash-flow channel or the cost-of-capital
channel. The cash-flow channel can be separated further into short-term profitability and long-term growth.

Change.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 47(9), pp. 69–91.
This article reviews the significant progress in academic research on economic impact of climate change and ex-
plores the implications for expected returns and strategic portfolio allocation across major public asset classes.
There have been numerous efforts to measure the environmental impact within a broader environment, social,
and governance framework with a focus on microeconomic and firm-level implications. In this article, the authors
assess the impact of climate change on long-term expected returns across asset classes from a top-down macroe-
conomic perspective. They use well-accepted climate risk scenarios to assess the potential impact of alternative
climate scenarios on economic growth, inflation, and asset returns for major asset classes. Finally, they design
hypothetical portfolios given these top-down assumptions and explore portfolio allocation implications.

of Complex Portfolios.” In: _Risk (Cutting Edge)_.
Pascal Traccucci, Luc Dumontier, Guillaume Garchery and Benjamin Jacot present an extended reverse stress
test (ERST) triptych approach with three variables: level of plausibility, level of loss and scenario. Any two of
these variables can be derived, provided the third is given as input. A new version of the Levenberg-Marquardt
optimisation algorithm is introduced to derive the ERST in certain complex cases.

multiple methods to evaluate evidence.” In: _Behaviormetrika_ 46(1), pp. 121–144.
Null hypothesis significance testing is cited as a threat to validity and reproducibility. While many individuals
suggest that we focus on altering the p value at which we deem an effect significant, we believe this suggestion
is short-sighted. Alternative procedures (i.e., Bayesian analyses and observation-oriented modeling: OOM) can
be more powerful and meaningful to our discipline. However, these methodologies are less frequently utilized
and are rarely discussed in combination with NHST. Herein, we discuss three methodologies (NHST, Bayesian
Model comparison, and OOM), then compare the possible interpretations of three analyses (ANOVA, Bayes
Factor, and an Ordinal Pattern Analysis) in various data environments using a frequentist simulation study.
We found that changing significance thresholds had little effect on conclusions. Furthermore, we suggest that
evaluating multiple estimates as evidence of an effect allows for more robust and nuanced interpretations of
results and implies the need to redefine evidentiary value and reporting practices. Recent events in psychological
science have prompted concerns within the discipline regarding research practices and ultimately, the validity and
reproducibility of published reports (Etz and Vandekerckhove 2016; Lindsay 2015, Open Science Collaboration
2015; van Elk et al. 2015). One often discussed matter is over-reliance, abuse, and potential hacking of p values
produced by frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), as well as misinterpretations of NHST


results (Gigerenzer 2004; Ioannidis 2005; Simmons et al. 2011). We agree with these concerns and believe that
many before us have voiced sound, generally accepted opinions on potential remedies, such as an increased focus
on effect sizes (Cumming 2008; Lakens 2013; Maxwell et al. 2015; Nosek et al. 2012). However, other suggestions
have been met with less enthusiasm, including an article by Benjamin et al. (2018) advocating that researchers
should begin thinking only of p values less than .005 as ”statistically significant”, thus changing alpha levels
to control Type I error rates. Alternatively, Pericchi and Pereira (2016) promote the use of fluctuating alpha
levels as a function of sample size to assist with these errors. Trafimow et al. (2018) critiques this suggestion to
broadly lower the alpha level to .005 and suggested that findings should be weighted on the basis of evidence
accumulation from multiple studies. We argue that alpha should not be the sole focus of our attention, but
rather, we should wonder if a p value should be utilized at all, and, if so, what that p value can tell us
in relation with other indicators. While NHST and p values may have merit, researchers have a wealth of
other statistical tools available to them. We believe that improvements may be made to the sciences as a
whole when individuals become aware of these tools and how these methods may be used, either alone or in
combination, to strengthen understanding of data and conclusions. These sentiments have been shared by the
American Statistical Association who recently held a conference focusing on going beyond NHST, expanding
their previous stance on p values (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016). Therefore, the main goal of this project was
to show researchers how two alternative paradigms compare to NHST in terms of their methodological design,
statistical interpretations, and comparative robustness. Herein, we will discuss the following methodologies:
NHST, Bayes factor comparisons, and observation-oriented modeling. To compare their methodological designs,
we first provide historical backgrounds, procedural steps, and limitations for each paradigm. We then simulated
data using a three timepoint repeated measures design with a Likert-type scale as the outcome variable to be
able to compare the statistical interpretations and comparative robustness. By simulating possible data sets
and analyzing them with each of the three paradigms, we will be able to discuss the conclusions these three
methods reach given the same data and to compare how often these methodologies agree within different data
environments (i.e., given varying sample sizes and effect sizes). Beyond simply comparing methodologies, we also
sought to identify how changing the alpha criteria within the NHST framework may alter conclusions. Although
previous work has already compared Frequentist NHST to Bayesian approaches (Goodman 1999; Rouder et
al. 2012; Wetzels et al. 2011), this manuscript adds a novel contribution: observation-oriented modeling. By
introducing social scientists to observation-oriented modeling (OOM), a relatively new paradigm that is readily
interpretable, we will show both how useful this paradigm can be in these contexts, and how it compares to two
well-known methods. We hope that by discussing these methodologies in terms of a simple statistical analysis
researchers will be able to easily compare and contrast methodologies.
van der Meulen, W. (2021).“Assessment of SRI portfolio performance with particular attention to crisis periods.”
MA thesis. University of Groningen.
This paper examines the risk-adjusted performance of SRI portfolios with particular attention to crisis periods.
The equally weighted SRI portfolios are created using the positive and best-in-class screening technique based on
ESG scores and the single dimension environmental, social and governance scores. A sample of 10216 companies
operating in both developed and emerging markets is used over the sampling period 2003 - 2020. The main
finding is that SRI portfolios do indeed pay a hedging cost over the full sample period to mitigate downside risk
during the crisis periods. This result is relevant for investors since it supports previous findings of the strong
performance of SRI portfolios in times of crisis.
van Tilborg, N. P.. (2021).“(Ir)responsible Investing: Revisiting the Effects of ESG Performance on Portfolio
Returns.” MA thesis. University of Groningen.
The sin stock anomaly where stocks belonging to ”sin” industries such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling and weapons
yield abnormal returns above the market return was observed decades ago. Presently, this anomaly fits into the
broader focus of investors on factors besides returns, such as ESG, and indications exist that high ESG might
result in excess returns. In this paper we investigate if ESG and returns are related. In order to investigate this,
we create decile portfolios based on the Refinitiv ESG Combined Scores of the individual stocks and test for the
presence of alpha in these portfolios using different models in the period 2003-2019. Throughout the models and
after robustness checks, it seems that actually the lowest ESG portfolio is the only one to yield a significantly
positive alpha.
Varmaz, A., Fieberg, C., and Poddig, T. (2021).“Portfolio optimization for sustainable investments.” In: _SSRN
e-Print_.


Investments in firms related to environment, social responsibility and corporate governance (ESG) aspects
have recently grown, attracting interest from both academic research and investment fund practice. This paper
develops a simple new portfolio optimization approach to include ESG in portfolio formation. In addition to
technical and practical advantages over a traditional mean–variance approach that incorporates ESG preferences,
our approach allows us to follow competing explanations of the relation among risk, return and ESG. An
extension of our portfolio optimization approach can even help distinguish competing explanations from the
literature, i.e., between the preferences of investors for ESG firm characteristics and exposure to a common ESG
risk factor. The proposed portfolio optimization approach is flexible enough to include additional risk factors
and/or characteristics. We demonstrate the application of our approach to empirical data.
Venturini, A. (2022).“Climate change, risk factors and stock returns: A review of the literature.” In: _International
Review of Financial Analysis_ 79, p. 101934.
This article reviews how climate change could be considered an additional source of market risk. I discuss the
types of data needed to analyse the climate risk drivers that shape the dynamics of the equity market. I present
empirical evidence at both the macro and micro-level, analysing whether and to what extent the equity market
prices climate change and related risks. Top-down and bottom-up approaches are compared to understand which
climate risk is more likely to affect the cross-section of stock returns, both within and across sectors. Emphasis
is also placed on investors’ beliefs about climate change risks, and the related asset pricing implications are
analysed. I conclude by illustrating further directions for both empirical and theoretical research in the field of
climate finance.

under a Multiple Testing Framework.” In: _The Journal of Portfolio Management_ 44(4), pp. 113–126.
Evaluating portfolios based on numerous combinations of factors using the individual backtesting method could
suffer from serious data mining bias and lead to spurious significant findings. Accordingly, the authors employ
a multiple hypothesis testing method to examine the multifactor portfolio performance. Their empirical results
show that even after they adjust for the multiple comparisons bias, stock-picking strategies with certain combined
firm characteristics could generate significantly better liquidity risk-adjusted returns. In addition, the outper-
forming multifactor strategies that the authors report are robust to alternative definitions of factors. However,
they observe that the number of significantly profitable multifactor portfolios has decreased substantially in the
era of increased liquidity and trading activity in the U.S. stock market.
Vojtko, R. and Padysak, M. (2020).“Quant look on ESG investing strategies.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
This paper reviews academic research about ESG factors and socially responsible investing. Probably the main
issue with ESG investing is caused by the ESG data. ESG scores vary across various datasets, which makes all
analyses complicated for academics, practitioners, and companies as well. We examine the literature to find the
correlation between datasets and the reasons for such dispersion among scores. Secondly, we are interested in
applying strategies based on the ESG scores. We conclude that ESG scores can be successfully used in practice,
utilized in negative screening, level, or momentum strategies. However, academic research must be examined
with attention to the ESG dataset, approach for the strategy construction, and time period. Otherwise, there
may be some dangerous generalizations.

holistic approach.” In: _SSRN e-Print_.
The low volatility factor in conjunction with the style factors Quality, Value and Momentum, has empirically
proven to be able to moderate market risks and improve a portfolio’s overall risk-return profile. By integrating
ESG into such a factor portfolio, future risks may be mitigated. We present a proprietary approach to managing
ESG risks that can maximize sensitivities to the desired multi-factor characteristics, and we calculate Climate
VaR under different global warming scenarios.
Vovk, V. and Wang, R. (2020).“True and false discoveries with e-values.” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
The topic of this paper is multiple hypothesis testing based on e-values, which are Bayes factors stripped of
their Bayesian content. Using e-values instead of p-values, which are standard in this area, leads to simple and
efficient procedures that control the number of false discoveries under arbitrary dependence of the base e-values.
We prove an optimality result for our main procedure and demonstrate advantages of our methods over standard
methods using simulated and real-world datasets.
Vovk, V. and Wang, R. (2021).“E-values: Calibration, combination, and applications.” In: _Annals of Statistics_
49(3), pp. 1736–1753.


Multiple testing of a single hypothesis and testing multiple hypotheses are usually done in terms of p-values.
In this paper we replace p-values with their natural competitor, e-values, which are closely related to betting,
Bayes factors, and likelihood ratios. We demonstrate that e-values are often mathematically more tractable; in
particular, in multiple testing of a single hypothesis, e-values can be merged simply by averaging them. This
allows us to develop efficient procedures using e-values for testing multiple hypotheses.
Walkshausl, C. (2018).“Dissecting the performance of socially responsible firms.” In: _The Journal of Investing_ 27(2),
pp. 29–40.
High-rated ESG (environmental, social, governance) firms do not outperform low-rated ESG firms in interna-
tional markets. However, ESG-rated firms in general outperform unrated firms after controlling for firm size,
book-to-market ratio, momentum, operating profitability, and investment. The following explanations are pro-
vided for these observations. First, though higher ESG ratings predict higher operating profitability and lower
investments, these positive return-generating firm characteristics are not priced within the universe of ESG-
rated firms, causing the insignificant return difference between high-rated and low-rated ESG firms. Second, the
positive excess returns of ESG-rated firms over unrated firms reflect price corrections arising from the reversal
of investors expectation errors concerning the impact of ESG characteristics on the firm future fundamental
performance and are therefore the outcome of mispricing.
Wang, Z., Liao, K., and Zhang, Y. (2022).“Does ESG Screening Enhance or Destroy Stock Portfolio Value? Evidence
from China.” In: _Emerging Markets Finance and Trade_ , pp. 1–15.
This article investigates the impact of ESG screening on the portfolio value of four risk weighting models in the
Chinese stock market from July 2012 to June 2019. Using a novel ESG rating data of CSI 300 composite stock, we
show that: (i) ESG screening undermines the portfolio value of the equal-weighted (EW), value-weighted (VW),
minimum variance (MVP), and reward-to-return (RRT) model. Portfolio models in the High-ESG group have the
lowest out-of-sample return, Sharpe ratio, and cumulative wealth. (ii) After adjusting for asset pricing models,
portfolio models in the High-ESG group generally produce the lowest out-of-sample risk-adjusted return per
IVOL. (iii) ESG screening harms portfolio value by excluding stocks with favorable risk-return characteristics,
leading to a conservative investment style, which is costly both for non-ESG-motivated and ESG-motivated
investors. Our findings reveal that although ESG investment is becoming a significant trend, portfolio managers
should be aware of the opportunity cost to apply ESG screening in emerging markets.
Webersinke, N., Kraus, M., Bingler, J. A., and Leippold, M. (2021).“ClimateBert: A Pretrained Language Model
for Climate-Related Text.” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
Over the recent years, large pretrained language models (LM) have revolutionized the field of natural language
processing (NLP). However, while pretraining on general language has been shown to work very well for common
language, it has been observed that niche language poses problems. In particular, climate-related texts include
specific language that common LMs can not represent accurately. We argue that this shortcoming of today’s
LMs limits the applicability of modern NLP to the broad field of text processing of climate-related texts. As
a remedy, we propose ClimateBert, a transformer-based language model that is further pretrained on over 1.6
million paragraphs of climate-related texts, crawled from various sources such as common news, research articles,
and climate reporting of companies. We find that ClimateBertleads to a 46% improvement on a masked language
model objective which, in turn, leads to lowering error rates by 3.57% to 35.71% for various climate-related
downstream tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and fact-checking.

ing Future Climate-Related Risk for Residential and Commercial Real Estate Portfolios.” In: _The Journal of
Alternative Investments_ 23(1), pp. 24–34.
This article explores how real estate investors and lenders can assess and manage the physical risks of climate
change through well-established risk models and climate scenarios. The authors propose a methodology that
real estate investors and lenders can use to improve their understanding and management of these risks. The
methodology is applied to a sample of 12 real estate portfolios with a total market value in excess of GBP2
trillion, spread across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, investigating the impacts of climate change
on losses from floods and winter storms (UK) as well as tropical cyclones (North America and the Pacific
Rim). The estimated changes in risk, especially in the climate scenario most aligned with the current warming
trajectory, raises important questions for investors, lenders, insurers, and policymakers as to how these new
levels of risk can be managed in the most cost-effective manner.
Wiecki, T., Campbell, A., Lent, J., and Stauth, J. (2016).“All That Glitters Is Not Gold: Comparing Backtest


and Out-of-Sample Performance on a Large Cohort of Trading Algorithms.” In: _The Journal of Investing_ 25(3),
pp. 69–80.
When automated trading strategies are developed and evaluated using backtests on historical pricing data, there
exists a tendency to overfit to the past. Using a unique dataset of 888 algorithmic trading strategies developed
and backtested on the Quantopian platform, with at least six months of out-of-sample performance, this ar-
ticle studies the prevalence and impact of backtest overfitting. Specifically, the authors find that commonly
reported backtest evaluation metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, offer little value in predicting out-of-sample
performance (R2 < 0.025). In contrast, higher-order moments, such as volatility and maximum drawdown, as
well as portfolio construction features (e.g., hedging), show significant predictive value of relevance to quanti-
tative finance practitioners. Moreover, in line with prior theoretical considerations, the authors find empirical
evidence of overfitting-the more backtesting a quant has done for a strategy, the larger the discrepancy be-
tween backtest and out-of-sample performance. Finally, they show that by training nonlinear, machine-learning
classifiers on a variety of features that describe backtest behavior, out-of-sample performance can be predicted
with much greater accuracy (R2 = 0.17) on hold-out data than when using linear, univariate features. A port-
folio constructed by using predictions on hold-out data performed significantly better out-of-sample than one
constructed from algorithms with the highest backtest Sharpe ratios.

link between ESG ratings and stock performance of European large cap firms.” MA thesis. Norwegian School of
Economics.
This thesis investigates the link between ESG ratings and stock performance of European large capitalization
firms. Using ESG ratings from three independent providers - Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg and Sustainalytics -
we examine differences in returns of zero-investment portfolios with a long position in the quartile consisting of
top ESG-rated firms and a short position the quartile consisting of low ESG-rated firms. We find differences in
return based on the choice of rating provider. Only Thomson Reuters portfolios earn negative annual abnormal
returns of 6.0%-8.4%, suggesting that investors pay a premium for better ESG-rated firms. Given the observed
differences in return and composition of the constructed providers’ portfolios, our findings suggest ESG ratings
are subjective and may cause confusion when implementing ESG features in a portfolio.

This article examines the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk on US stocks through the
lens of Sustainalytics’ ESG risk-rating measure over the past decade. The author finds that stocks with low ESG
risk ratings (green stocks) not only have higher realized returns but also provide better tail-risk protection than
stocks with high ESG risk ratings (brown stocks), especially during the COVID-19 crisis. The tail-risk protection
provided by green stocks is robust within sectors and styles. Green funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
that hold green stocks have attracted significantly more fund flow than their counterparts, which is associated
with the outperformance for both green funds and stocks.

“SustainBench: Benchmarks for Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Machine Learning.” In:
_arXiv e-Print_.
Progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been hindered by a lack of
data on key environmental and socioeconomic indicators, which historically have come from ground surveys
with sparse temporal and spatial coverage. Recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to utilize
abundant, frequently-updated, and globally available data, such as from satellites or social media, to provide
insights into progress toward SDGs. Despite promising early results, approaches to using such data for SDG
measurement thus far have largely evaluated on different datasets or used inconsistent evaluation metrics, making
it hard to understand whether performance is improving and where additional research would be most fruitful.
Furthermore, processing satellite and ground survey data requires domain knowledge that many in the machine
learning community lack. In this paper, we introduce SustainBench, a collection of 15 benchmark tasks across
7 SDGs, including tasks related to economic development, agriculture, health, education, water and sanitation,
climate action, and life on land. Datasets for 11 of the 15 tasks are released publicly for the first time. Our goals
for SustainBench are to (1) lower the barriers to entry for the machine learning community to contribute to
measuring and achieving the SDGs; (2) provide standard benchmarks for evaluating machine learning models
on tasks across a variety of SDGs; and (3) encourage the development of novel machine learning methods where
improved model performance facilitates progress towards the SDGs.


Yoshino, N. and Yuyama, T. (2021).“Studies of Applied Economics.” In: _ESG/Green Investment and Allocation of
Portfolio Assets_ 39(3).
This article examines the current portfolio allocation in ESG and Green projects. Traditional investments fo-
cus on rates of return and risks associated with investment. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) or
Green factors are additional components that investors have to pay attention to. Environmental protection is
very important. However, as we see the current different definitions of ESG or Green factors lead to distorted
allocations in portfolio investments. In order to bring portfolio allocations to a desirable direction, global tax-
ation on pollution or creation of an accurate Green credit rating based on emissions of various pollutants are
recommended.
Yu, L. (2021).“Comparing Classical Portfolio Optimization and Robust Portfolio Optimization on Black Swan
Events.” MA thesis. University of Waterloo.
Black swan events, such as natural catastrophes and manmade market crashes, historically have a drastic negative
influence on investments; and there is a discrepancy on losses caused by these two types of disasters. In general,
there is a recovery and it is of interest to understand what type of investment strategies lead to better performance
for investors. In this thesis we study classical portfolio optimization, robust portfolio optimization and some
historical black swan events. We compare two main strategies: mean variance optimization vs robust portfolio
optimization on two types of black swan events: natural vs anthropogenic. The comparison illustrates that
robust portfolio optimization is much more conservative, and has a shorter recovery time than classical portfolio
optimization. Moreover, the losses in the stock investment resulted from a natural disaster are very minor
compared to the losses resulted from an anthropogenic market crash.

on Sample Reweighting and Feature Selection for Financial Data Analysis.” In: _IEEE International Conference
on Data Mining (ICDM)_. IEEE.
Modern machine learning models (such as deep neural networks and boosting decision tree models) have become
increasingly popular in financial market prediction, due to their superior capacity to extract complex non-linear
patterns. However, since financial datasets have very low signal-to-noise ratio and are non-stationary, complex
models are often very prone to overfitting and suffer from instability issues. Moreover, as various machine
learning and data mining tools become more widely used in quantitative trading, many trading firms have been
producing an increasing number of features (aka factors). Therefore, how to automatically select effective features
becomes an imminent problem. To address these issues, we propose DoubleEnsemble, an ensemble framework
leveraging learning trajectory based sample reweighting and shuffling based feature selection. Specifically, we
identify the key samples based on the training dynamics on each sample and elicit key features based on
the ablation impact of each feature via shuffling. Our model is applicable to a wide range of base models,
capable of extracting complex patterns, while mitigating the overfitting and instability issues for financial market
prediction. We conduct extensive experiments, including price prediction for cryptocurrencies and stock trading,
using both DNN and gradient boosting decision tree as base models. Our experiment results demonstrate that
DoubleEnsemble achieves a superior performance compared with several baseline methods.
Zhang, F., Guo, R., and Cao, H. (2020b).“Information Coefficient as a Performance Measure of Stock Selection
Models.” In: _arXiv e-Print_.
Information coefficient (IC) is a widely used metric for measuring investment managers’ skills in selecting stocks.
However, its adequacy and effectiveness for evaluating stock selection models has not been clearly understood,
as IC from a realistic stock selection model can hardly be materially different from zero and is often accompanies
with high volatility. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of IC as a performance measure of stick selection
models. Through simulation and simple statistical modeling, we examine the IC behavior both statically and
dynamically. The examination helps us propose two practical procedures that one may use for IC-based ongoing
performance monitoring of stock selection models.

12(3), pp. 53–63.
Investments aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles are rapidly growing globally. In
the exchange traded fund (ETF) industry, this gives rise to the power of ESG rating firms that have the influence
to direct capital flows into ETFs tracking the indexes. This article examines the issues of substantial ESG rating
divergence across rating firms, the impact on investors’ choices, and the influence on the ETF industry. The
divergence appears to be the greatest in social and governance components, and is often qualitative in nature.
The author found that certain economic sectors are more prone to ESG rating divergence than others. She


presents a case study about two ESG ETFs that are viewed quite differently under various rating lenses, and
offers suggestions to investors, advisors, and analysts on how to research ESG ETFs, given the major rating
divergence. The article concludes with ways the ETF industry could improve its practices collectively to better
serve investors with clarity and to sustain the growth of ESG impact investments.

Financial Data Science_ 22(4), pp. 8–20.
In this article, the authors adopt deep learning models to directly optimize the portfolio Sharpe ratio. The
framework they present circumvents the requirements for forecasting expected returns and allows them to
directly optimize portfolio weights by updating model parameters. Instead of selecting individual assets, they
trade exchange-traded funds of market indexes to form a portfolio. Indexes of different asset classes show robust
correlations, and trading them substantially reduces the spectrum of available assets from which to choose. The
authors compare their method with a wide range of algorithms, with results showing that the model obtains the
best performance over the testing period of 2011 to the end of April 2020, including the financial instabilities
of the first quarter of 2020. A sensitivity analysis is included to clarify the relevance of input features, and the
authors further study the performance of their approach under different cost rates and different risk levels via
volatility scaling.
