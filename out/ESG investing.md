## 1 Motivation for the project

Investors throughout the world are increasingly interested in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing.
The 2021 Global Sustainable Investment Reportindicated a significant increase for sustainable and responsible
investments, bringing the total to USD 35.3 trillion.
Many investors have social or ethical reasons for ESG investing, and academic and practitioner surveys indicate
that majority of surveyed investment professionals believe that incorporating ESG information into an investment
evaluation process is relevant to investment performance.

### 1.1 ESG-based portfolio construction

ESG identifies factors that reflect environmental considerations (E), societal preferences (S), and governance of the
firm (G) and may complement, or compete with, classical portfolio construction methods. It is complementary if
the ESG factors enhance alpha. It is competitive if the factors detract from alpha.

### 1.2 ESG ratings and scores

Billio et al. (“Inside the ESG Ratings: (Dis)agreement and Performance,” 2021): Analysis the ESG rating criteria
used by prominent agencies indicate a lack of a commonality in the definition of ESG (i) characteristics, (ii)
attributes and (iii) standards in defining E, S and G components. Such heterogeneity in rating criteria can lead
agencies to have opposite opinions on the same evaluated companies and that agreement across those providers was
found to be substantially low in many cases.

### 1.3 Climate-based investing

Climate risk is denitively back on the agenda of investors and goes beyond ESG ratings. However, climate risk
assessment methodologies have not reached maturity. Nevertheless, the development of climate risk measures and
their sophistication have an increasing impact on portfolio construction and management. While first developed on
the side of passive management and low-carbon equity indices, these approaches are now gaining a lot of traction
in active management.

### 1.4 Portfolio diversification and tail risk protection through ESG investing

Diversification is one of the most important concepts in the financial world. It is often said that diversification
is the only free lunch in finance. From a qualitative point of view, the concept of diversification is quite clear: a
portfolio is well-diversified if shocks in the individual components do not heavily impact on the overall portfolio.
Relatively simple to understand then but profoundly difficult to define. Indeed, there is no broadly accepted precise
and quantitative definition of diversification.
One of the most vexing problems in investment management is that diversification seems to disappear when
investors need it the most. A key challenge in the construction of diversified multi-asset portfolio strategies is that
even a seemingly well-balanced allocation to many asset classes can eventually translate into a portfolio with a very
concentrated set of underlying risk exposures.
Incorporating ESG into portfolios may also improve their diversification behavior.

### 1.5 Practical challenges with ESG investing

Practical challenges include

- inconsistent ESG metrics and ratings
- particularly noisy data
- entanglement of ESG factors with standard risk factors


The lack of standardized ESG metrics creates opportunities for greenwashing by companies less interested in pur-
suing legitimate ESG objectives, than in building brand by meeting minimum criteria for metrics that may be
somewhat easy to game.
ESG data typically are deficient in the following areas:

- Quantity: Not enough data are available.
- Consistency: Companies often report different ESG data items.
- Quality: Methodologies used to derive or compute the reported ESG data mayvary across companies.

## 3 Practical details for the project

The main purpose of the project described in this document is to provide exposure to students on important (and
interesting) practical topics in quantitative wealth and investment management QWIM.
The level of complexity depends on the number of hours designated for the project. For example, 50-60 hours for
a regular project, and 100-120 hours for a thesis/capstone project. Upon request, the scope (and the corresponding
number if hours) of any given project can be extended.
The students would work on the project as part of a team (usually with 2-3 students).
All QWIM projects were selected such that the students’ efforts have a good chance of producing results relevant
to the industry, and at least as good as the results presented in the QWIM literature. Thus for each project we
may consider (on an optional basis, based primarily on students’ preference) to submit a corresponding article to
journals widely followed by practitioners and academics in investment and wealth management, with participating
students included as the leading coauthors of the submitted article.
The main challenge for each project is to identify the criteria for what would be considered **“good enough** ”.
Similar to projects in the industry, the meaning of “good enough” is based on a combination of comprehensive
literature review, discussions within team and with me (and/or my colleagues) and analysis of results. Emphasis is
placed on creating a narrative (with the aid of an interactive visualizer) for convincing the intended audience that
what was done in the project delivers **“good enough** ” outcome.

### 3.1 Interaction with students

For each project I would make myself available for meetings on a weekly basis (for discussions and guidance).
Some of my colleagues have also expressed interest to participate in such meetings. Due to our work schedule and
deliverables, most of the discussions will have to be scheduled outisde working hours (in weekends or evenings).
The meetings will take place through video conferencing such as WebEx, Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams,
etc., based on the team’s preference. If the meetings are through WebEx, I would provide a link, while the student
team will provide a link for any other video conferencing tool.
The students working on a given project can also send questions by email (my recommendation is to aggregate
the questions from team members into an email sent once a day). We aim to provide answers within 1-2 days, either
by email or through a phone discussion.

### 3.2 Data.

Due to compliance reasons all projects would be based on publicly available, non-proprietary and non-confidential
data (indices, ETFs, mutual funds, etc.). Since neither I nor my team are allowed to provide these datasets, I can
only provide a list of suggested datasets. This list is included in a later section named Practical Info.
The datasets were selected to have the following features:

- be good proxies for most representative asset and subasset classes
- to be widely available
- to be as liquid as possible
- to have daily granularity
- to encompass periods with as many market regimes as possibles (most proposed daily datasets are from 1990
    or 1991)
- time series have “nicer” statistical properties compared to time series of, say, individual stocks or bonds

### 3.3 Private GitHub repository for the QWIM project.

The team will create a private GitHub repository, which will store relevant project materials, including codes. The
team will use Git Desktop application as source control repository linked to the GitHub repository.


### 3.4 Deliverables.

The project deliverables include literature survey, numerical results, analysis and visualization. For each project
references will be provided for a comprehensive literature survey, and students are encouraged to identify additional
relevant literature. Regarding the implementation, the project will primarily use existing codes:

- Python and R packages from official repositories (PyPi for Python and CRAN for R)
- machine learning platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, Chainer, mlr3, H20, PlaidML, mlpack, etc.
- implementations of articles through codes available in repositories such as GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.
Visualization of data and results visualization will be interactive and it will be based on Shiny R framework; to
reduce programming effort, a template for such a Shiny visualizer will be provided in the team private GitHub
repository.
The deliverables are:
- written report including literature survey and numerical results
- interactive visualizer (most likely Shiny-based visualizer using R and Python packages)
- (optional) presentation slides, and/or RMarkdown presentation, and/or Jupyter Notebook(s)

### 3.5 (Optional) Article submission to leading journals

On an optional basis (based primarily on students’ preference), a version of the report can be prepared for submision
to leading journals such as Journal of Financial Data Science, Journal of Portfolio Management, Journal of Asset
Management, Journal of Investment Strategies, Quantitative Finance, Journal of Wealth Management, Journal of
Investing, Journal of Machine Learning in Finance, etc.


## 4 Project tasks and timelines

For each project the main tasks are:
1) literature review
2) decide on the appropriate metrics and quantitative methods within context of "good enough" for the project
3) write-up summary of literature review: methods, metrics, testing procedures
4) identification of Python and/or R packages which are most appropriate for the selected methods and metrics
5) code design to decide on main code components
6) implementation of code components
7) interactive visualization of numerical results
8) project report containing description of methods, metrics, and tests, and analysis of results.

### 4.1 Suggested timelines for project tasks

The table below suggests a timeline for the project tasks and the corresponding percentages of project time:

```
Table 1: Suggested timeline for project tasks
Task ID Task Name Percentage of project time
1 Literature review 15%
2 Identification of "good enough" metrics and quantitative methods 5%
3 Write-up of summary of literature review 5%
4 Identification of appropriate packages in Python and/or R 10%
5 Code design for main components of project coding framework 5%
6 Implementation of coding framework and components 40%
7 Interactive visualizer using the provided Shiny template 10%
8 Project report and presentation 10%
```
### 4.2 Literature review.

The first task is based on a comprehensive literature survey, included in the preliminary document of the project.
Students are encouraged to identify additional relevant literature.
This task may be the most important of the project, since it provides an overview of what was done, what works
well and less well, and what appear to be the most promising avenues to complete the project.
Emphasis is placed on information contained in the Main References; the other References would be considered
only if time permits and the team is interested in exploring other avenues.
When reading the literature, there are 4 main directions to consider:
1) methods
2) metrics to assess the performance/robustness of the methods
3) testing procedures
4) numerical results
The primary focus would be on the the references included in "Main References" subsection of the document for your
QWIM project. Then, to the extent there is time, to consider the other references included in the project document.
In the same time, you are encouraged to identify other references that might be considered "Main references", and
to share those references with me for discussion.
For the articles in Main References category, the suggested approach would be the following:


- For each article focus primarily on Abstract, Conclusion, and Numerical Results
- Do this for all articles considered to be Main References, such that you gain a high-level understanding of
    what is currently done in the literature
- Select the metrics that you may want to use in order to quantify the meaning of "good enough" for the project.
- Select the quantitative methods which appear to be most likely to be "good enough" for the project.
- Perform a "deeper dive" into the articles containing the approaches you consider the most promising,
For the articles which are not in "Main References" category, read Abstract, Conclusion, and Numerical Results, to
see whether any of those articles might need to be considered for inclusion in your summary.

### 4.3 Write-up summary of literature review.

The write-up summary summarizes the methods, metrics, testing procedures, and numerical results identified during
the literature review. The write-up could also be incorporated within reports and/or presentations for the QWIM
project.

### 4.4 Identification of appropriate Python and/or R packages

Based on the literature review and on diiscussions, we identify the most potentially useful methods, metrics and
testing procedures. Then wee identify the most appropriate implementations of the selected methods and metrics.
The primary sources of implementatins are existing codes from:

- Python and R packages from official repositories (PyPi for Python and CRAN for R)
- machine learning platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, Chainer, mlr3, H20, PlaidML, mlpack, etc.
- Codes available in repositories such as GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.

### 4.5 Code design.

An important task is to have a code design session to decide in advance on the main code components, which are
meant to be modular and encapsulated, such that the entire team can work on the codes.
Examples of such main components include extracting data, calculate metrics for the considered procedures,
portfolio metrics, performing tests, construct interactive visualizer, etc.
The code design procedure consists of:
1) visual display of major components of the coding framework
2) UML diagrams for each of the components.
The Appendix contains an illustrative example within context of a QWIM project on forecasting of financial
time series. The first figure shows the major components, while the second figure shows UML diagrams of those
components (the names of data members and methods are currently generic, and one would need to change them
to appropriate names)
While these figures were obtained through Microsoft Visio using a code design file (.vsd file), there are other
software tools (either online or installed locally) which can be used to create such code design diagrams. NOTE: if
you have access to Microsoft Visio and you want to use it for code design diagrams, you can ask me for the .vsd
file which was exported into the PDF from which I have extracted the snapshots.
List of software tools for code design diagrams, which are either free (open source) or have a free type of account

- Modelio (eitherdesktopversion oronlineversion)
- LucidChart (online)
- draw.io (eitherdesktopversion oronlineversion, now called app.diagrams.net)


- Visual Paradigm (online)
- UMLet (eitherdesktopor onlineversion)
- Curated list of UML tools – 2019 edition
- Top online UML modeling tools in 2019

### 4.6 Implementation of coding framework and components

The implementation is done using identified packages or codes, in Python and/or R. The project will primarily use
existing codes:

- Python and R packages from official repositories (PyPi for Python and CRAN for R)
- machine learning platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, Chainer, mlr3, H20, PlaidML, mlpack, etc.
- implementations of articles through codes available in repositories such as GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.

### 4.7 Interactive visualizer.

While visualization of data and numerical results can be done through various tools (including Jupyter notebooks
or Dash in Python), my recommendation is to consider an interactive visualizer based on Shiny framework in R.
A template for the Shiny visualizer will be provided in the private GitHub repository set up by the team for the
project.
Some information about Shiny:

- Shiny from RStudio: tutorialsand gallery
- Why R Shiny Trumps UI and JavaScript Based Visualization Tools
- Shiny’s Holy Grail: Interactivity with reproducibility

### 4.8 Project report and presentation.

The report containing description of methods, metrics, and tests, and analysis of results.
While the report can be written using various tools (including Microsoft Word), my recommendation is to use
LyX to write both the project report and the project presentation. Two LyX templates for creating reports and,
respectively, presentations will be provided in the private GitHub repository set up by the team for the project.
Some information about Shiny:

- LyX features
- LyX tutorialwith PDFhere
- LyX Tutorial videoPart Oneand Part Two
- LyX tutorial videoPart Oneand Part Twoand Part Threeand Part Four
- Introduction to LyX
- Insert figures in LyX
- Essentials of LyX


## 5 Design and implementation for the project codes

This section describes a possible approach for the design process and for the implementation (folder structure) of
the project. This approach is presented only to exemplify how it could be done. Each student team has freedom to
consider their own design process.
Design and implementation would be based on following principles:

- coding framework is Python based, with calls to functions available in existing Python and R packages
- leverage common components (such as data input/output, numerical methods, time series, testing, interactive
    visualization and reporting, etc.)
- reusability
- incorporate best practices in coding and numerical implementations
- use, augment and enhance (to largest extent possible) existing Python and R packages and codes

### 5.1 Visualize project workflow and coding framework.

The starting point is to visualize the project workflow in terms of major components, and then to design the code
framework.
The code design procedure consists of:
1) visual display of major components of the coding framework
2) UML diagrams for each of the components.
We present examples below for projects including time series forecasting and analysis, machine learning for portfolio
construction, etc.

## mark portfolios

For your QWIM project it is likely that you would compare investment portfolios constructed using your method(s)
versus benchmark portfolios constructed using most common "optimal portfolio" types used in the industry and in
academia. See below for an example of how this can be done.

### How to compare investment portfolios

Let us consider portfolio optimization methods (selected from the ones implemented in Python and/or R packages
mentioned above, such as PyPortfolioOpt) which rely on based on expected returns and expected covariance matrix.
One would construct two portfolios (let’s call them Traditional and Enhanced) using the same portfolio op-
timization method(s), where the only difference would be in terms of the inputs (expected returns and expected
covariance matrix) to the optimization method:
As of the date of portfolio construction, expected returns and expected covariance matrix can be either calculated
using only historical data or, respectively, output from your model. Then one would compare side-by-side various
portfolio metrics for these two portfolios. Comparison would be done across the entire Out-Of-Sample period, and
also across each market regine period.
NOTE: If you have N forecasting methods used in your coding framework, then for each optimizaton method
you would end up with (1+N) optimal portfolios
To exemplifty, let’s say that you want to construct portfolios at date of June 20, 2019, and you have data as
below

- Range of entire dataset: January 1st, 1990 - August 1, 2020
- Range of Training dataset: January 1st, 1990- February 20, 2017
- Range of Test dataset: February 20, 2017 - August 1, 2020
For Traditional portfolio:
- vector of expected means is calculated based on historical data available at June 20, 2019 (namely from 1990
to June 19, 2019)
- expected covariance matrix is calculated based on historical data available at June 20, 2019 (namely from
1990 to June 19, 2019)
For Enhanced portfolio:
- vector of expected means is calculated based on forecasted values available at June 20, 2019 and obtained
using the forecasted model trained on given training dataset (which is from 1990 to 2017)


- expected covariance matrix is calculated based on forecasted values available at June 20, 2019 and obtained
    using the forecasted model trained on given training dataset (which is from 1990 to 2017)
Then one would compare various portfolio metrics among the two portfolios. These metrics can be calculated on
following time periods:
- from date of portfolio construction (June 20, 2019) to last date for which you have data (August 1, 2020)
- from starting date of dataset (January 1st, 1990) to last date for which you have data (August 1, 2020)
- from starting date of dataset (January 1st, 1990) to date of portfolio construction (June 20, 2019)
So you would have side-by-side comparisons of portfolio metrics for each of the above 3 time periods.
Portfolio metrics can be calculated using various Python and/or R packages mentioned above.
