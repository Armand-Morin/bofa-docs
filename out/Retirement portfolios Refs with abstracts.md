We investigate health and aging before and after retirement for specific occupational groups. We use five waves
of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and construct a frailty index for elderly men
and women from 10 European countries. Occupational groups are classified according to low vs. high education,
blue vs. white collar color, and high vs. low physical or psychosocial job burden. Controlling for individual fixed
effects, we find that, regardless of the used classification, workers from the first (low status) group display more
health deficits at any age and accumulate health deficits faster than workers from the second (high status)
group. We instrument retirement by statutory retirement ages (”normal” and ”early”) and find that the health
of workers in low status occupations benefits greatly from retirement, whereas retirement effects for workers
in high status occupations are small and frequently insignificant. We also find that workers from low status
occupations always have higher health deficits, i.e. we find evidence for an occupational health gradient that
widens with increasing age, before and after retirement.
Ackerley, A., Nefouse, N., and Nikles, D. (2022\). To spend or not to spend? Tech. rep. BlackRock.
This was not what we expected to find: on average across all wealth levels, most current retirees still had 80% of
their pre\-retirement savings after almost two decades of retirement according to research conducted jointly with
the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). One\-third even grew their assets over the course of retirement.
While that sounds like good news, the reasons why some retirees did not spend their assets may be complicated.
Certainly some may have benefited from greater access to defined benefit pensions, more income replacement
from Social Security, strong real estate appreciation and an investment market that generally delivered strong
returns and high interest rates. On the other hand, some retirees may not have spent their savings due to
uncertainty, perhaps even hoarding assets at the expense of fully supporting the retirement lifestyle they might
have enjoyed. In order to better understand why retirees either spent down assets or held on to them, BlackRock
engaged Greenwald and Associates to conduct 19 in\-depth interviews and survey 1,510 retirees.
Interviews for the survey portion of this study were conducted online in February 2018\. To qualify for this
study participants had to be fully retired for at least five years are between the ages of 60 and 80, and have
investable assets between $200,000 and $2,500,000\. Survey results have been weighted to reflect the overall make
up of Americans retired for five years or longer. In a similarly sized random sample survey of general population
respondents, the margin of error (at the 95% confidence level) for the total population in this study would be
plus or minus approximately 2\.5 percentage points.
We identified six key themes and drivers of retiree spending behavior that emerged from the findings and offer
”lessons learned” advice for participants and retirees, employers and advisors.
1\)Retirees prefer to keep their assets untouched
2\)Retirees more often plan to spend consistently \- increasing with age
3\)Retirees retain their accumulation mindset
4\)Retirees with pension income least likely to spend down. Because they don’t need to.
5\)Men and women approach finances in retirement differently, and mostly for good reason
6\)More recent retirees are less optimistic

Measurement: Monotonicity with Respect to the Sharpe Ratio and Multivariate Tests of Correlation .” In:SSRN
e\-Print.
This paper reports an investigation into methods of portfolio performance measurement. The work is motivated
first by equivocal empirical evidence reported by several authors about the correlation of performance measures
with the Sharpe ratio. Secondly it is motivated by recent work which specifies that performance measures will
be monotone functions of the Sharpe ratio if portfolio returns follow the same location\-scale distribution. The
paper demonstrates that the class of location\-scale distributions is broader than previously reported. It presents
conditions under which monotonicity with respect to the Sharpe ratio will fail. The paper shows that for large
sample sizes the correlation between pairs of performance measures that are functions of the Sharpe ratio is
unity. The correct null hypothesis for tests of correlation is therefore rho\=1\. Two multivariate tests of this
null hypothesis are presented. The new tests are used to carry out of a comprehensive study of performance
measurement for a set over ninety UK investment trusts.

Cost to Do So? ” In:Journal of Financial Planning .
This study examined the extent to which deferring the claiming date for Social Security benefits preserved an
individual’s tax\-deferred retirement assets, thus enhancing the ability to provide for constant real consump\-
tion. The analysis incorporated the relevant reductions and credits for early and late claiming, mortality risk,
stochastic investment returns, and the availability of longevity insurance. Results provide guidance for financial
planners to help clients make the optimal claiming decision. For single and married individuals with substantial
savings, the deferral of benefits reduced the risk of retirement asset exhaustion. The results demonstrate the
unique nature of the Social Security asset in the retirement portfolio as well as the value of self\-insuring against
longevity risk.

ment and Insurance Review 22(1\), pp. 57–100\.
Against the background of aging societies and increasing life expectancies, the protection of individuals from
outliving their savings has become increasingly relevant. Annuities represent insurance against longevity risk
and can prevent old\-age poverty. The aim of this article is to present the current state of theoretical, empirical
and experimental evidence with regard to annuitization decisions. Toward this end, we conduct a systematic
literature review that includes 89 articles. Based on this, we study welfare effects of mandatory annuitization,
annuitization rates and the optimal fraction of wealth to be annuitized, as well as determinants of retirees’ choice
to annuitize and their impact on annuity demand. Finally, we present possible solutions for overcoming the low
uptake of annuities based on its causes. One main result is that behavioral biases in annuitization decisions
particularly require considerably more theoretical research and empirical evidence, and that theoretical models
already appear to well explain empirically observed annuitization rates.

We develop valuation and risk techniques for the future benefits of a retiree who participates in the American
Social Security program based on their chosen date of retirement, the term structure of interest rates, and
forecasted life expectancy. These valuation methods are then used to determine the optimal retirement time of a
beneficiary given a specific wage history and health profile in the sense of maximizing the present value of cash
flows received during retirement years. We then examine how a number of risk factors including interest rates,
disease diagnosis, and mortality risks impact benefit value. Specifically, we utilize principal component analysis
in order to assess both interest rate and mortality risk. We then conduct numerical studies to examine how such
risks range over distinct income and demographic groups and finally summarize future research directions.

Investing Model (VLCM): A general portfolio framework for goals\-based investing . Tech. rep. Vanguard.
Investors have multiple goals throughout their lifetime, each requiring them to make complex, interconnected
decisions about saving, spending, and asset allocation. We present a framework for making asset allocation de\-
cisions based on an investor’s goals, preferences, and personal circumstances and factoring in the uncertainty of
asset returns. The Vanguard Life\-Cycle Investing Model (VLCM) is a proprietary model for glide\-path construc\-
tion that can assist in the creation of custom investment portfolios for retirement as well as nonretirement goals,
such as saving for college. The VLCM embodies key principles of life\-cycle investing theory, including a utility\-
based framework encompassing risk aversion and time preference. It also incorporates important behavioral
finance considerations such as loss aversion and income shortfall aversion. The use of the VLCM enables cost\-
benefit analysis of glide\-path customization, evaluation of risk\-return trade\-offs of various asset and sub\-asset
allocation choices, and multiple portfolio analytics of the probability of success and odds of income sufficiency.
Based on VLCM’s analytical framework, we find that risk\-aversion levels are the dominant factor behind the
broad stock\-bond split in the glide path, affecting both glide\-path slope and ending allocation.
Alleva, B. (2016\). “Discount Rate Specification and the Social Security Claiming Decision .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Choosing the claiming age that maximizes the expected present value of lifetime Social Security retirement ben\-
efits requires a survival function to account for an individual’s prospective longevity along with the specification
of a rate by which to discount the future benefit payments for each claiming age. This article evaluates optimal
claiming ages for prospective beneficiaries across a range of 81 real discount rate options (specified in increments
of one\-tenth of 1 percent) from 0 percent to 8 percent, considering the survival functions for men and women
born in 1952\. It examines the implications of choosing a given rate as well as the sensitivity of the optimal
claiming age to a specific rate choice.

The rules for claiming Social Security retired\-worker benefits are complex in large part because they offer
a potential claimant flexibility in choosing a claiming age most to his or her advantage. The complexity of
those rules is multiplied for a married couple, as the potential eligibility for spousal benefits, the couple’s age
difference, and other factors must also be considered. The number of claiming\-age combinations available to
a married couple varies widely for couples with different circumstances. This note explores the claiming rules,
contingent situations, claiming\-age combinations, and benefit amounts available to married couples across a
range of respective birth years and benefit levels based on respective earnings histories.
Alleva, B. J. (2015\). “Minimizing the Risk of Opportunity Loss in the Social Security Claiming Decision .” In:The
Journal of Retirement 3(1\), pp. 67–86\.
The optimal age to claim Social Security benefits is often defined as that which maximizes expected lifetime
benefits. Expectations are not always met however, and this optimal claim age is unlikely to be that which would
have maximized lifetime benefits received by the eventual age at death. The optimal claim age then carries the
potential for an opportunity loss, or the risk of receiving less than the maximum possible, which varies with age
at death. This study evaluates the claiming decision by first computing and presenting the maximizing claim
age for each possible death age over the retirement horizon, and then determining the actual opportunity loss
for each death age for claiming at the otherwise optimal claim age. The potential for opportunity loss over the
retirement horizon is then computed for the optimal claim age. If a participant can target a period within the
retirement horizon for which the values total lifetime benefits higher than the remainder, the optimal claim age
for that target period will entail less risk, or less potential for opportunity loss, than that for optimizing over
the entire retirement horizon. Such a strategy could effectively address gaps in a retirement income portfolio.

This paper measures the cost of biased retirement expectations for investors in target\-date funds. Using survey
data, we show that respondents systematically underestimate their long\-run labor participation on average by
4\.8 years, with errors having meaningful cross\-sectional relationships. We use these insights to build a life\-cycle
model of target\-date funds to measure the costs of biased expectations. Calibrations suggest that errors in
expectations compound over time, costing the median respondent 4% of total wealth, equivalent to 0\.2% a year.
These estimates suggest that the choice architecture of target\-date funds should be modified to improve the
financial adequacy of future retirees.

Rates.” In:SSRN e\-Print .
The discount rate represents a critical choice in accounting for corporate defined\-benefit pension plans due to
the long\-term nature of pension liabilities. U.S. GAAP and IFRS mandate the AA corporate bond rate. Their
requirement is subject to much debate, with the risk\-free rate and the expected return on pension assets (EROA)
often proposed as alternatives. We examine which of these rates best fits pension values as perceived by equity\-
and debt\-market participants. For equity values, the EROA rate dominates, while for credit ratings, the AA rate
dominates. For financially healthy firms, however, discounting at the EROA produces the best fit for both equity
values and credit ratings. In contrast, for firms nearing financial distress, discounting at the AA rate provides
the best fit. We also find that the accumulated benefit obligation measure consistently dominates the projected
benefit obligation in explanatory power for credit ratings. Overall, we find that market participants adjust
GAAP\-recognized pension obligations in both amount and discount rate, in a manner that appears consistent
with firm\-specific economic realities.
28Armour, P. and Hung, A. (2017\). “Drawing down Retirement Wealth: Interactions between Social Security Wealth
and Private Retirement Savings .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Individual financial planning for retirement in the US is increasingly important, given the trend away from
employer\-provided defined benefit (DB) plans, the rising Social Security (SS) Full Retirement Age (FRA), and
retiring baby boomers. A key financial decision that Americans make is how to draw on their retirement wealth
across various sources, including both privately saved retirement funds and SS benefits. For SS retirement
benefits, the main decision is at what age to claim, with claiming before the FRA resulting in lower monthly
benefits, and claiming later leading to higher benefits. The terms of this tradeoff have changed in recent years:
since 2003, the FRA has risen from 65 and will gradually increase to 67 by 2027, representing a drop in the
present value of SS benefits. Meanwhile, defined contribution (DC) plans have gained in popularity, presenting
retirees with more control over their private retirement wealth. The changing dynamics of both SS wealth and
the private retirement decision space underscore the need for examining how individuals make decisions across
their entire portfolio of retirement wealth. We use HRS survey data matched to SS administrative data to study
how households integrate SS benefits into their general retirement income plans. We find starkly different non\-SS
retirement asset decumulation patterns across individuals who claim at different ages, with those claiming before
the FRA drawing down pension and IRA wealth faster than those who claim at or after the FRA. However, the
earliest claimants, those who claim SS retirement benefits exactly at age 62, are a highly heterogeneous group,
consisting of both low\-income, high expected mortality individuals as well as individuals with high pension
holdings. We further find that this earliest claimant group is more likely to have retired and begun decumulating
non\-SSretirementassetsevenbeforeage62;however,thisgroup’smedianandaverageassetsarenotsubstantially
lower than later claimants. An analysis of claiming behavior by non\-SS retirement wealth holdings shows that
individuals with more retirement savings were overwhelmingly likely to claim between the ages of 62 and the
FRA. On the other hand, those with the least retirement savings are more likely to either claim SS benefits as
early as possible, either in the form of disability benefits or retirement benefits, or they would delay claiming
SS retirement benefits until after the FRA. Moreover, birth cohorts facing higher FRAs tend to delay claiming
SS retirement benefits on average; however, those most affected by this reduction in SS wealth \- those with few
other retirement assets \- are the least reactive. Finally, households that do delay claiming as the FRA rises also
tend to delay retirement and drawing down their non\-SS retirement assets, indicating complementarity between
SS and non\-SS decumulation decisions and strong spillovers from changes in both SS and private retirement
policy.
Armour, P. and Knapp, D. (2021a). The Changing Picture of Who Claims Social Security Early . Tech. rep. AARP
Public Policy Institute.
From the early 1990s to 2010s, the fraction of individuals claiming Social Security retirement benefits at the
early eligibility age (EEA) of 62 declined from over half of the eligible population to less than a third. Although
claiming at 62 can make financial sense for some, Social Security benefit rules result in reduced monthly benefits
of up to 30 percent relative to waiting to claim benefits until full retirement age. Such a considerable benefit
reduction persists for life\- and threatens financial security at later ages. This report highlights differences over
time between individuals who claim Social Security retirement benefits at age 62 and those who claim after
age 62\. It documents how these populations have changed in terms of education, labor force participation,
pension plan participation, and wealth\-and how demographic, employment, and economic characteristics relate
to claiming age. This report is the first in a two\-part series; the second report focuses on the later\-in\-life financial
and well\-being consequences of early claiming.
The authors identify the demographic, employment, and economic characteristics associated with those who
claim at the EEA and relate these characteristics to people who claim after it. For both men and women,
individuals who claim Social Security benefits at 62, as compared with those who claim later:
1\)Have less education, on average;
2\)Are more likely to live in rural areas;
3\)Are more likely to already have a worklimiting health condition;
4\)Have a lower reported likelihood of living to age 75;
5\)Are less likely to have a job before turning age 62;
6\)If employed before turning age 62, earn less, on average;
7\)If employed before turning age 62, are more likely to have a physically demanding job.
29With respect to wealth and pension comparisons of age\-62 claimers to later claimers, Armour and Knapp find
individuals who claim Social Security benefits at 62:
1\)Are substantially more likely to already be receiving pension income;
2\)Are less likely to have defined contribution plan assets.
The authors caution that even after accounting for the interrelationship of observable demographic, employment,
and economic factors using regression analysis, these characteristics account for only a small fraction of the shift
toward later claiming. Other reasons\-such as longer life expectancy, a greater ability to work longer, better
understanding of the financial benefits of waiting to claim Social Security benefits, and stronger incentives to
delay claiming due to changes in Social Security benefit rules\-likely influence people to wait to claim their
benefits.
Finally, although the novel coronavirus pandemic has not yet been associated with increases in claiming Social
Security retirement benefits (Goss and Glenn 2020\), as short\-term furloughs turn into long\-term unemployment,
the findings in this report suggest that employment losses may lead to earlier claiming\-in particular among those
with less education and those living in more rural areas. As the second report in this series makes clear, the
financial consequences of early claiming can be long lasting.
Armour, P. and Knapp, D. (2021b). The Consequences of Claiming Social Security Benefits at Age 62 . Tech. rep.
AARP Public Policy Institute.
Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits comes with an important tradeoff: claiming benefits at the
early eligibility age (EEA) of 62 allows beneficiaries earlier access to their monthly Social Security payments,
but these payments will be lower for life than if the beneficiary had waited. Despite the reduction in monthly
benefits, almost one\-third of people still claim Social Security retirement benefits at the EEA. Delayed claiming
is often promoted by financial advisers and retirement experts for its higher monthly benefits (there is an almost
8 percent boost in monthly benefits for each year someone delays claiming). Nevertheless, little is known about
whether claiming Social Security benefits at the EEA leads to substantively different short\- and long\-term
outcomes than does claiming later. This report, the second in a two\-part series, focuses on the consequences for
individuals who claim at the EEA; it estimates both short\- and long\-term differences between otherwise similar
individuals who claim Social Security retirement benefits at age 62 and those who claim later.
KEY FINDINGS In comparing matched age\-62 claimants against later claimants with similar characteristics,
Armour and Knapp find:
1\)Age\-62 claimants stop working earlier and cash out defined contribution plans sooner.
2\)Age\-62 claimants have lower household income throughout their 60s and 70s (on average, $10,000\-$20,000
less in annual household income).
3\)Age\-62 claimants in their 70s have substantially less liquid wealth than do later claimants at similar ages
(on average, 27 percent lower at age 74 and 43 percent lower at age 80\).
4\)Measures of financial hardship and mortality rates are not statistically or substantively different between
the two claiming groups into their 70s.
The findings of this report are limited in a couple of significant ways that may underestimate the effects of
claiming early. First, given the time frame, HRS data do not allow the authors to track households past age
80, which likely understates the relative advantage of claiming later since the benefits of delayed claiming grow
substantially in claimants’ 80s. Second, individuals observed in their late 70s claimed in the 1990s or early
2000s\-and thus faced a lower penalty for early claiming than more recent cohorts, who were subject to different
Social Security benefit rules. In addition, more recent cohorts are living longer; therefore, someone turning 62
today has a stronger incentive to delay claiming, all else equal.
Armour, P. and Knapp, D. (2022\). “The consequences of claiming Social Security benefits at age 62 .” In:Journal
of Pension Economics and Finance , pp. 1–27\.
Delaying claiming of Social Security old\-age benefits past the earliest eligibility age, age 62, raises the monthly
benefit for a person’s life. Despite arguments from both proponents and opponents of delayed claiming in
academia and public discourse, little is known about whether claiming decisions lead to substantively different
outcomes. We compare differences in outcomes between age\-62 claimants and otherwise similar later claimants
that are matched on health, employment, and financial characteristics at age 60\. We find that age\-62 claimers
are substantially less likely to work after 62 and have persistently lower income into their 70s. Differences in
assets emerged in the 70s, with early claimants having lower wealth, but we find no differences in mortality or
30self\-reported financial hardship. The difference in wealth is driven primarily by a growth in wealth among later
claimants rather than substantial decumulation by age\-62 claimants.

In:The Journal of Financial Data Science 1(1\), pp. 64–74\.
Machine learning offers a set of powerful tools that holds considerable promise for investment management. As
with most quantitative applications in finance, the danger of misapplying these techniques can lead to disap\-
pointment. One crucial limitation involves data availability. Many of machine learning early successes originated
in the physical and biological sciences, in which truly vast amounts of data are available. Machine learning
applications often require far more data than are available in finance, which is of particular concern in longer\-
horizon investing. Hence, choosing the right applications before applying the tools is important. In addition,
capital markets reflect the actions of people, which may be influenced by others actions and by the findings
of past research. In many ways, the challenges that affect machine learning are merely a continuation of the
long\-standing issues researchers have always faced in quantitative finance. While investors need to be cautious,
more cautious than in past applications of quantitative methods new tools offer many potential applications in
finance. In this article, the authors develop a research protocol that pertains both to the application of machine
learning techniques and to quantitative finance in general.

Target\-date investment strategies purport to meet the two primary objectives of any retirement savings program:
maximizing the real value of investors’ nest eggs while minimizing uncertainty around prospective income in
retirement. The authors demonstrate that the classic glidepath approach to retirement investing moving from
equity\-centric to bond\-centric investing as we age does not meet these objectives. The authors summarize the
flaws in traditional glidepath implementation and explore illustrative changes to the rules\-based, mechanistic
solution for retirement planning that can improve the expected outcome for investors, using simulations to test
alternatives. Their findings show that, even with simple rules\-based approaches, there are better ways to achieve
our financial objectives for retirement.

seven schemes, including the 110 minus age rule of thumb and strategies employed by popular retirement mutual
funds. Historically, the 100 percent equity portfolio has offered the highest returns with little extra risk. However,
if the authors lower equity premiums or bootstrap historical results, then retirement mutual funds and the 110
minus age rule of thumb perform somewhat better than 100 percent equity portfolios in adverse circumstances.
But overall, a 100 percent equity portfolio provides the highest wealth accumulation.
Assabil, S. E. and Mcleish, D. L. (2021\). “Assessing the Impact of Longevity Risk for Countries with Limited Data .”
In:The Journal of Retirement 8(3\), pp. 62–75\.
The impact of longevity risk has not been well studied in most developing countries due to the lack of suit\-
able mortality data. As a result, most pension companies in these countries (especially those on the African
continent) do not account for longevity risk in their annual valuation. This can even lead to their collapse if
steps are not taken to address it. In this work, we develop a method of assessing longevity risk where there is a
31severe lack of mortality data. The method is based on the assumption that there is a nearly linear relationship
between annuitant’s hazard function and their mortality at higher ages (post\-retirement age), which permits
approximating with the Gompertz model. We tried the method on mortality data from Ghana and the results
are consistent with those in the standard literature. That is, longevity risk is a treat to pension companies in
Ghana even though, in the case of Ghana, this treat has partially been mitigated by the high\-interest rate in
the country. With this method, pension and life companies that are not able to account for longevity risk as
a result of lack of data or newly formed pension companies with even two\-year mortality data will be able to
assess the longevity risk they face without relying on data or models from other countries.
Atkins, A. B. and Caliendo, F. N. (2009\). “Strategies for maximizing social security benefits .” In:The Journal of
Wealth Management 12(1\), pp. 25–31\.
People nearing retirement face a well\-known decision: When should Social Security benefits be initiated?
The answer may not seem obvious since there is a key trade\-off involved. The retiree can choose low benefits
for a longer period of time, or high benefits for a shorter period of time, or something in between. The optimal
initiation date that maximizes Social Security wealth is a quantitative question and it depends on the life
expectancy of the person and on the real rate of return they expect to earn on their investments, among other
things.
The authors attempt to provide some answers to this practical and important question. Their focus throughout
is on relatively high\-wealth individuals who will receive the maximum Social Security benefits. They show how
the government Social Security benefit calculator makes recommendations on the optimal age to initiate benefits
be inappropriate for high\-wealth individuals.
They conclude with the following rough rules of thumb
Take benefits early ( i.e., at age 62\): If an individual expects to make a good return on their investments. This
is true regardless of their life expectancy.
Take benefits later (i.e., at age 70\): If an individual expects to make modest investment returns and they expect
to live a long time.

In:Journal of Applied Statistics 49(3\), pp. 1752\-763–12\.
The Lee\-Carter model is a well\-known model in modeling mortality. We aim to compare three probability models
(Poisson, negative binomial and binomial) based on the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework of the Lee\-
Carter model. These models are applied to mortality data for 10 selected countries (Japan, United States, United
Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, Spain, Belgium, Canada, Netherlands and Bulgaria) and the fit of these models
is assessed using the deviance statistics and standardized residuals against fitted value plot. Among these three
models, the negative binomial Lee\-Carter model gave the best fit based on the deviance statistics and estimates
of the log of deaths.

In:SSRN e\-Print .
In this paper we assess the suitability of different risk profiling measures when individuals are involved in a
process of discovering their willingness to take risks over different decision modes. The latter involve decisions
under ambiguity, decisions after gaining experience and receiving outcome information on previous decisions.
We find that risk taking is associated with individuals’ risk preferences in all decision modes but not with their
investment experience. Although simulated experience improves the risk awareness and supports a higher risk
taking, it cannot substitute the assessment of risk preferences and in particular the assessment of individual’s
loss aversion. In contrast, self\-assessed risk tolerance measures are not suitable for predicting risk taking in any
decision mode. If risk preferences cannot be assessed, only the gender can be used as a predictor of risk taking.

As a response to unforeseeable market turbulence – such as the 2008 financial crisis and the most recent market
drawdown triggered by the COVID\-19 pandemic – we propose a new pension investment strategy that could
better protect a long\-term pension plan in volatile market conditions. Over a hypothetical 20\-year pension
scheme and various target volatility scenarios, we show that our newly proposed strategy, which attaches a
target volatility mechanism to a lifecycle strategy, could provide more effective capital protection and risk
control for pension investment vehicles. Our results are robust with a consideration of transaction costs.

In:Journal of Investment Management 15(1\), pp. 75–87\.
In mathematical finance, backtest overfitting connotes the usage of historical market data to develop an invest\-
ment strategy, where too many variations of the strategy are tried, relative to the amount of data available.
Backtest overfitting is now thought to be a primary reason why investment models and strategies that look
good on paper often disappoint in practice. Models and strategies suffering from overfitting typically target the
specific idiosyncrasies of a limited dataset, rather than any general behavior, and, as a result, often perform
erratically when presented with new data. In this study, we address overfitting in the context of designing a
mutual fund or investment portfolio as a weighted collection of stocks. Very often a newly minted equity\-based
fund of this type has been designed by an exhaustive computer\-based search of some sort to obtain an optimal
weighting that exhibits excellent performance based, say, on the past 10 or 20 years’ historical market data, and
the fund often highlights this backtest performance.

costs in retirement . Tech. rep. Vanguard.
Vanguard engaged Mercer Health \& Benefits to develop a model to forecast health care costs for U.S. retirees.
Vanguard believes retirement planning frameworks should be adapted as follows: 1\) Planning for annual health
care insurance premiums and out\-of\-pocket expenses at retirement should be distinct from planning for long\-
term care expenses. 2\) Some research estimates health care costs in retirement as a lifetime lump sum. We
believe a better planning framework considers these costs as annual expenses personalized to an individual’s
health status, coverage choices, retirement age, and loss of any employer subsidies. For a typical 65\-year\-old
woman, the Mercer\-Vanguard model predicted an annual health care expense of $5,100 for 2020\. 3\) During their
working years, some people should save at higher rates to account for potential future incremental health care
spending. This group includes those with generous employer benefits that may not be offered in retirement and
those with higher risk of chronic conditions because of family history or current health status 4\) Long\-term care
costs represent a separate and difficult planning challenge because of the wide distribution of potential outcomes.
Half of the population will never incur them\-but everyone faces a small but meaningful risk of requiring costly
care for multiple years.

Why do individuals retire and claim their Social Security benefits at the age they do? Understanding the key
drivers of these decisions has been an important topic of research as it can help guide policy discussions on
the impact of potential reforms to the Social Security program. We revisit this crucial question by exploring
new sources of heterogeneity in these decisions as well as novel mechanisms governing these trade\-offs. Using
data from the Health and Retirement Study and the Understanding America Survey, we first document (1\)
important heterogeneities in social security claiming behavior of men by their education and marital status, (2\)

majority of individuals claim Social Security benefits prior to their normal retirement age, despite large penalties
associated with these early benefit claims. We show that the estimated model can closely match the claiming
behavior as seen in the data and also produce differences in SS claims along the dimensions of heterogeneity
considered. Counterfactual experiments indicate that precautionary motives, misinformation, and preferences
governing future discounting as well as altruism, together, go a long way in explaining overall claiming behavior.
Together, these forces can explain a third of the overall early benefit claims and two\-thirds of age 62 claims\-
with varying intensities across education and marital groups.

The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) undertook a study examining the extent to which the non\-
housing assets of certain retirees changed during their first 20 years of retirement (or until death, if earlier).
ThestudyreliedonincomeandassetdatafromtheHealthandRetirementStudy(HRS),themostcomprehensive
surveyofolderAmericansinthecountry,andonspendingdatafromtheConsumptionandActivitiesMailSurvey
33(CAMS), a supplement to HRS.
Highlights:
1\)The study shows that retirees generally exhibit very slow decumulation of assets.
2\)More specifically, within the first 18 years of retirement, individuals with less than $200,000 in non\-housing
assets immediately before retirement had spent down (at the median) about one\-quarter of their assets;
those with between $200,000 and $500,000 immediately before retirement had spent down 27\.2 percent.
Retirees with at least $500,000 immediately before retirement had spent down only 11\.8 percent within the
first 20 years of retirement at the median.
3\)While some retirees do spend down most of their assets in the first eighteen years following retirement,
about one\-third of all sampled retirees had increased their assets over that period.
4\)Pensioners were much less likely to have spent down their assets than non\-pensioners. During the first 18
years of retirement, the median non\-housing assets of pensioners (who started retirement with much higher
levels of assets) had gone down only 4 percent, compared to 34 percent for non\-pensioners.
5\)The median ratio of household spending to household income for retirees of all ages hovered around one,
inching slowly upward with age. This suggests that majority of retirees had limited their spending to their
regular flow of income and had avoided drawing down assets, which explains why pensioners, who had
higher levels of regular income, were able to avoid asset drawdowns better than others
All numbers are measured in 2015 dollars.

Lifecycle funds offered to retirement plan participants gradually reduce exposure to stocks as the funds ap\-

dynamic allocation strategies proposed in this article exhibit almost stochastic dominance over strategies that
unidirectionally switch assets without consideration of portfolio performance.

that describe investment risk using probability tails. Risk preferences and error propensity were found to vary
significantly across sociodemographic groups and levels of financial literacy. Our findings should assist regulatory

mortality tables? Similarities and differences in three national samples .” In:The Journal of the Economics of
Ageing16 (100241\).
Estimates of personal longevity play a vital role in decisions relating to asset accumulation and decumulation.
Subjective life expectancy (SLE) is a measure of individuals’ expectation of remaining years of life. Either
explicitly or implicitly, it is a key determinant of consumption and savings behaviour, and may be guided by
a person’s own health and health behaviours. The Gateway to Global Aging, a platform for the Health and
Retirement Study’s (HRS) family of population surveys, provides harmonised longitudinal datasets for many
countries, each based on individual survey responses from respondents aged 50 and above. In this paper, we
analyse SLE three of these datasets: the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), The Irish Longitudinal
34Study of Ageing (TILDA) and Healthy Ageing in Scotland (HAGIS). First, we focus on measurement of SLE,
followed by the SLE differential \- the discrepancy between SLE and mortality risk indicated by population life
tables. One novel finding from our analysis is that the SLE differential is positive for Ireland and is negative
for Scotland and England. This difference does not appear to be explained by differences of survey design or
population characteristics.

Planning 34(4\), pp. 74–80\.
Since 1993, I’ve been researching sustainable withdrawals from retirement portfolios and searching for some\-
thing: a complete, soup\-to\-nuts approach to managing the withdrawal process\-from construction of the original
withdrawal plan, through monitoring the plan and identifying deviations, to applying corrections, as needed. I
present in this article my version of the financial planner’s complete toolkit for managing withdrawal plans. As
with any area of financial planning, you can’t launch the initial plan and expect it to be appropriate for the
client forever. A withdrawal plan needs to be actively managed to determine if the plan no longer suits a client’s
needs, and to make appropriate changes to bring the plan back into focus.
In a way, this article is more of an overview rather than a complete delineation of the process. My approach
relies heavily on graphical elements: dozens of charts are required as part of the toolkit. Furthermore, owing to
the large number of variables involved, withdrawal planning is imbued with an inherent complexity. Accordingly,
there simply isn’t room in an article of this length to provide you with the level of detail demanded for a full
exposition of my methods. So, consider this a test drive and please wait for the production models to be released
in the near future.
I’ll proceed in three steps:
1\)Establishing the withdrawal plan (determining, among other variables, the withdrawal scheme and initial
withdrawal rate).
2\)Monitoring the plan for deviations.
3\)Making corrections to the plan, as required (or as desired by the client).
These three steps may be repeated several times during the life of the client’s plan.

Journal of Property Research 34(3\), pp. 181–210\.
This paper examines the wealth maximisation and preservation effects of including commercial real estate in
retirement\-phase portfolio management. Prior research addresses the role of real estate during the wealth\-
accumulation phase of the investor lifecycle; however, little is known about the contribution of real estate during
the invest\-and\-spend, or decumulation, phase. To address this issue, we estimate short\-fall risk based on the
widely known 4% Rule. We use pricing data for multiple asset classes and simulation techniques, combined with
a robust correlation structure, to examine: short\-fall risk sensitivity to alternative spending rules; the impact
of public vs. private real estate allocations; wealth preservation as an investment objective; and the effect of
real estate on upside, or wealth maximisation, potential. We find short\-fall risk in a decumulation portfolio
decreases with substantial allocations to real estate. This result holds for a portfolio including either public or
private real estate. Additionally, and under most conditions, the best performing decumulation\-phase portfolios
include a real estate allocation with both public and private real estate exposure. These results have significant
implications for investors, whether they be retirees, plan administrators or endowments, as well as financial
economists studying the lifecycle of investment decisions.
Bernhardt, T. and Donnelly, C. (2018\). Pension Decumulation Strategies: A State\-of\-the\-Art Report . Tech. rep. Risk
Insight Lab, Heriot\-Watt University.
35This report is focused on income withdrawal and investment strategies that are proposed for decumulation in
retirement. Popular strategies which are used in practice and specifications of how to decide the income and
investment strategy are reviewed.
One of the most popular rules, the SWR or ”4% rule”, is very simple and easy to implement. The retiree invests
in a constant\-mix strategy and withdraws an inflation\-indexed income for 30 years. There is intended to be a
90% chance of the strategy being successful.
However the constant\-mix investment strategy is criticized by Scott et al. (2009\) as being too expensive. In
many possible future scenarios, there is an excess of assets at the end of 30 years. That means that the retiree
has followed a wasteful strategy. They have paid for surpluses in excess of their stated goal. Moreover, there is
a chance that the retiree could exhaust their funds before 30 years are up. Scott et al. (2009\) show that options
or a different dynamic strategy could be employed to give either better outcomes for the same cost or the same
outcomes for a lower cost.
As shown repeatedly in the literature, optimal investment strategies are dynamic strategies. They are usually
not constant\-mix strategies, although their exact dynamics depend on the optimization problem. In contrast,
many drawdown products in the market are constant\-mix strategies. Optimal withdrawal rates, when allowed
to be a decision variable, also vary over time. How much they vary will depend on the problem specification.
However, if the problem set\-up allows for risk aversion, then the withdrawal rate will vary less as the investor
becomes more risk averse.
Annuities or modern tontines should be part of any decumulation strategy, particular at older ages. They are
a cost\-efficient strategy which either eliminate or significantly reduce the chance of running out of money. In
general, the annuity or modern tontine should be incorporated into the retiree’s assets when their mortality is
the main driver of the decumulation strategy. This is the case when buying these products has a higher value
than trading solely in the financial market.
There are many approaches to specifying the decumulation problem. Utility theory\-based methods, such as
Expected Utility Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory, allow for investor risk aversion. This latter property
can give intuitively appealing results. However, the problem specification is not easy to communicate.
Minimizing the difference between the actual consumption and a desired consumption via the minimization of
a quadratic function has also been studied. Closed\-form solutions are difficult to obtain.
Probabilistic methods, such as minimizing the probability of ruin, appear more objective. However, as they don’t
allow for investor risk aversion, the results can potentially be unattractive. The problems have to be carefully
specified in order to obtain an agreeable solution.
Habit formation tries to match actual consumption behaviour closely. The investor seeks to keep their consump\-
tion above a weighted average of their past consumption. It may be difficult to justify such a formulation to the
investor. Similarly, a problem specification (confusingly called drawdown) where the probability of the investor’s
wealth falling below some fraction of their running maximum wealth is minimized, may also be hard to explain
as a decumulation goal.

rule and strategic weights), and consistently perform better than mean\-variance, Bayes Stein, and minimum\-
variance strategies in terms of out\-of\-sample Sharpe ratios, even after controlling for different levels of risk
aversion, investment constraints, and transaction costs. The BL model generates portfolios with lower risk, less
extreme asset allocations, and higher diversification across asset classes. Sensitivity analyses indicate that these
advantages are due to more stable mixed return estimates that incorporate the reliability of return predictions,
smaller estimation errors, and lower turnover.

Bhansali, V. (2015\). “Tail\-Risk Management for Retirement Investments .” In:The Journal of Retirement 2(3\),
pp. 78–86\.
One of the insights of behavioral finance is the tendency for small investors to overreact to market swings. Even
a well\-structured portfolio may be vulnerable to panic selling in a downturn.
The article explains how a policy of tail\-risk hedging could deter such behavior by putting a floor on drops in
the portfolio. Instead of maintaining an overly conservative stance and an unnecessarily low share of equities,
investors could hedge their portfolios by relying on options, which have become a much more feasible tool for
the small investor in recent years.
The article discusses the relationship between the time to retirement and the need to hedge. Investors nearing
retirement have to adopt a more defensive position or hedge explicitly, but younger investors can be more
aggressive and buy options with lower strike prices.

Saving Plans covering a representative sample of French employees. We find that relative to self\-managing,
accessing the robo services is associated to an increase in the time investors spend to follow their portfolios
and to an increase in trading activities. After having taken up the robo, investors are willing to increase their

They also experience higher risk\-adjusted returns. These effects tend to be stronger for investors with smaller

Biggs, A. G., Chen, A., and Munnell, A. (2021\). “The Consequences of Current Benefit Adjustments for Early and
Delayed Claiming .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Workers have the option of claiming Social Security retirement benefits at any age between 62 and 70, with
later claiming resulting in higher monthly benefits. These higher monthly benefits reflect an actuarial adjustment
designedtokeeplifetimebenefitsequal,foranindividualwithaveragelifeexpectancy,regardlessofwhenbenefits
are claimed. The actuarial adjustments, however, are decades old. Since then, interest rates have declined; life
expectancy has increased; and longevity improvements have been much greater for high earners than low earners.
This paper explores how changes in longevity and interest rates have affected the fairness of the actuarial
adjustment over time and how the disparity in life expectancy affects the equity across the income distribution.
It also looks at the impact of these developments on the costs of the program and the progressivity of benefits.
The paper found that:
1\)The increases in life expectancy and the decline in interest rates argue for smaller reductions for early
claiming and a smaller delayed retirement credit for later claiming.
2\)Specifically, the benefit at 62 should equal 77\.5 percent, as opposed to 70\.0 percent, of the full age\-67
benefit, and the benefit at 70 should equal 119\.9 percent, instead of 124\.0 percent, of the full benefit.
373\)The outdated actuarial adjustments are a modest moneymaker for the program \- about $1\.9 billion in 2018,
with most of the gains coming from those claiming at 62, who are typically lower earners.
4\)Surprisingly, the correlations between earnings and life expectancy and between earnings and claiming
behavior have only modest implications for both the cost and progressivity of Social Security benefits.
5\)Finally, the cost and distributional effects of earnings\-related life expectancy and claiming cannot be ad\-
dressedthroughtheactuarialadjustmentsforearlyandlateclaiming.Theyreflectthefactthathighearners
get their large benefits for a long time and low earners get their more modest benefits for a shorter time.
The policy implications of the findings are:
•Increases in life expectancy and the decline in interest rates suggest smaller reductions for early claiming
and a smaller delayed retirement credit for later claiming.
•Accounting for differential mortality would involve changing benefits, and is not a problem that can be
solved by tinkering with the actuarial adjustments.
This study considered Consequences of Current Benefit Adjustments for Early and Delayed Claiming.
Biggs, A. G. (2017\). “The life cycle model, replacement rates, and retirement income adequacy .” In:The Journal
of Retirement 4(3\), pp. 96–110\.
The key insight of the life cycle model in economics is that a household consumption at any given time is
determined not so much by its current income as by the total income available to the household over its lifetime.
A replacement rate can be a useful tool in approximating the life cycle model predictions for how households
prepare for retirement. The Social Security Administration Office of the Chief Actuary ( OACT) publishes two
different calculations of retirement income replacement rates, each of which finds that Social Security benefits
replace about 40% of a typical retiree pre\-retirement earnings. Some interpret these figures as indicating that
SocialSecuritybenefitsareinsufficientlygenerousandthatU.S.householdstotalretirementsavingisinadequate.
But OACT two methods for calculating replacement rates both violate the life cycle model in a meaningful way.
OACT career\-average earnings replacement rates, in which lifetime earnings are first indexed upward by the rate
of economywide wage growth, exaggerates by roughly one\-fifth the real value of earnings available to a household
for consumption over its lifetime. This overstatement lowers a household measured ability to replace their
pre\-retirement earnings. OACT final\-earnings replacement rates effectively compare Social Security retirement
benefits to pre\-retirement earnings only in the years in which the individual worked, ignoring the life cycle
model prediction that household consumption is a function of long\-term average earnings, including years in
which a household member was not employed. A replacement\-rate calculation more consistent with the life cycle
model would compare retirement income to an average of real earnings calculated over a significant number of
years. Such an approach would find substantially higher replacement rates for the typical retiree. It is important
both for Social Security policy and the analysis of overall retirement savings adequacy that replacement\-rate
calculations build on the insights of the life cycle model that guides most economic analysis of retirement saving.

Operations Research 256, pp. 21–40\.
Most portfolio selection rules based on the sample mean and covariance matrix perform poorly out\-of\-sample.
Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence that such optimization rules are not able to beat simple rules
of thumb, such as 1/N. Parameter uncertainty has been identified as one major reason for these findings. A
strand of literature addresses this problem by improving the parameter estimation and/or by relying on more
robust portfolio selection methods. Independent of the chosen portfolio selection rule, we propose using feature
selection first in order to reduce the asset menu. While most of the diversification benefits are preserved, the
parameter estimation problem is alleviated. We conduct out\-of\-sample back\-tests to show that in most cases
different well\-established portfolio selection rules applied on the reduced asset universe are able to improve alpha

This article introduces a new model to jointly determine the optimal allocation to equities, real assets, and
annuities for a retiree with a given set of preferences. This model improves on a number of existing retirement
income models by directly incorporating a cost associated with deviating from the investor’s target risk prefer\-
ence, jointly testing the effects of four preference variables aversion to volatility, strength of a bequest motive,
preference for sustainable expenditure, and sensitivity to the risk of future inflation using a dynamic withdrawal
strategy and taking a probabilistic approach to mortality.
Blanchett, D. (2018\). “Health shocks and subsequent retiree spending .” In:The Journal of Retirement 6(1\), pp. 55–
69\.
Healthcare expenses are receiving increasing attention from retirees (and the media) today and many financial
planners are starting to think about how to potentially incorporate these expenses into a financial plan. This
article explores some of the key considerations associated with modeling healthcare\-related expenses for retirees
with a focus on the impact of these expenses on future retiree spending (and consumption) using data from
the Health and Retirement Study. We find that households that experience unexpected out\-of\-pocket healthcare
expenses tend to decrease spending by more than those who do not. For example, if healthcare expenses in a
given year exceed 10% of total spending (excluding health insurance premiums, which we define as a health
shock), then future total spending, nondurable spending, and consumption drop by approximately 5% more
than households that do not experience the shock. Financial advisors (and households) interested in including
healthcare expenses as part of a financial plan should be aware of this effect since it can potentially reduce the
actual financial implications associated with a retiree health shock (or other retiree healthcare expenditures).
Blanchett, D. (2020a). “The Benefit of Diversified Guaranteed Income for Retirees: Combining Immediate Fixed
and Variable Annuities .” In:Retirement Management Journal 2(3\).
This paper explores the potential benefits of developing a retirement income that considers both immediate fixed
annuities (IFA) and immediate variable annuities (IVA) using a stochastic utility model combined with a sce\-
nario framework. Optimal annuity allocations vary considerably across household type, but certainty equivalent
retirement income increases by 20 percent, on average, when incorporating annuities. Total annuity allocations
increase when both IFAs and IVAs are considered, and retirees realize only approximately two\-thirds of the
benefits of annuitization when just one annuity type is considered. IVA allocations were typically higher than
IFA allocations because most households already have a base level of fixed guaranteed income (through Social
Security); therefore, IVAs can be a unique diversifier from a retirement\-income perspective. Overall, this anal\-
ysis strongly suggests retirees (and financial advisors) should consider annuities as part of a retirement\-income
strategy, and that they should consider different types of annuities to create the best possible plan.
Blanchett, D. (2020b). “The value of allocating to annuities .” In:The Journal of Retirement 8(1\), pp. 40–52\.
This article explores the costs and benefits associated with different approaches a financial advisor could take
toward using (or not using) annuities across his or her entire book of clients (i.e., for an entire cohort of retirees).
Fees are used to proxy the implied total expenses (or costs) for the two approaches, and not surprisingly, the
relative fees between the portfolio and the annuity has a significant impact on the respective benefit of each.
For example, a financial advisor would be better off not recommending annuities at all (on average), if the
investment\-only approach is considered to be low cost and the annuity approach is assumed to be high cost.
If the fees for both approaches are assumed to be moderate (i.e., the implied total expenses of the strategies
are equal), which is the most realistic scenario for financial advisors providing high\-quality advice to clients,
the average annuity allocation across scenarios is approximately 30% and helping retirees allocate to annuities
optimally generates a total of 73 basis points of alpha\-equivalent benefit compared with a financial advisor that
does not consider annuities as part of the retirement plan. The marginal alpha\-equivalent benefit associated
with optimal annuitization strategies, which is estimated by focusing on the total additional benefit generated
from allocating to annuities based on the percentage of assets actually used to purchase the annuity, is closer to
150 basis points\-a level of increased risk\-adjusted performance that would be almost impossible for a financial
advisor to overcome using traditional investments (i.e., ignoring annuities).

Blanchett, D. (2021b). “Minding the Gap in Subjective Mortality Estimates .” In:The Journal of Retirement 9(2\),
pp. 8–20\.
This article explores the accuracy of subjective life expectancy estimates using data primarily from the from
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Although individuals appear to some sense about their likelihood
of survival (i.e., their subjective mortality), there are notable gaps in these estimates, consistent with past
research. Evidence suggests that although subjective estimates may be relatively accurate, on average, and that
households appear to do a relatively good job considering various objective factors (for example, health status),
there are often significant errors in individual forecasts, and households do not appear to correctly consider
all the relevant objective factors (such as income and smoking). Therefore, financial planners need to educate
themselves on how to better model and personalize mortality assumptions into financial plans versus relying on
purely subjective estimates to ensure that planning assumptions are as accurate as possible.
Blanchett, D. and Cormier, W. (2021\). “Right\-Sizing Retirement: Exploring the Retirement Consumption Gap in
Early Retirement .” In:Journal of Financial Planning 34(2\), pp. 68–81\.
Research suggests some households underspend in retirement, resulting in a ”retirement consumption gap.” This
paper explores this effect, specifically during the first 10 years of retirement, and incorporates both household
assets and pre\-retirement spending using data from the Health and Retirement Study. Only 18 percent of
households have enough wealth to cover pre\-retirement consumption when they retire, which suggests most
households will not be able to maintain their pre\-retirement lifestyle in retirement\-a finding consistent with
other general estimates of the retirement readiness of Americans. Real financial assets decline for 65 percent of
households during the first 10 years of retirement, with a median real decline of 35 percent. Real retiree spending
declines for 75 percent of households during the first 10 years of retirement, with a median annual decline
of approximately 2 percent per year. This suggests financial planners should consider changes in retirement
spending that are less than inflation as part of a retirement plan. The percentage of households that can fund
their retirement consumption increases dramatically during the first 10 years of retirement, from 18 percent to
48 percent, primarily due to reductions in spending. This suggests households ”right\-size” their spending early in
retirement to better align with available resources. It is not clear, though, to what extent this behavior persists
further into retirement (due to data limitations). Many well\-funded households could increase consumption, but
appear not to do so (i.e., exhibit a retirement consumption gap). Potential reasons include the desire to leave
a bequest, uncertain medical expenses (especially late in retirement), uncertain life expectancy, etc. While this
group is a minority of retiree households, understanding what drives this behavior is especially important to
financial planners since this group tends to have the most accumulated wealth and are, therefore, more likely to
seek the services of, or use, a financial planner.
Blanchett, D., Finke, M., and Pfau, W. (2018\). “Low Returns and Optimal Retirement Savings .” In:How Persistent
Low Returns Will Shape Saving and Retirement . Oxford University Press.
Lifetime financial outcomes relate closely to the sequence of investment returns earned over the life cycle. Higher
return assumptions allow individuals to save at a lower rate, withdraw at a higher rate, retire with a lower wealth
accumulation, and enjoy a higher standard of living. While analysis of this topic is often based on historical
investment performance, present bond yields are historically low and equity prices are quite high, suggesting
that individuals will likely experience lower returns in the future. This implies the need for higher savings rates,
lower withdrawal rates, a larger nest egg at retirement, and a lower lifetime standard of living. We show that
lower\-income workers will need to save about 50 percent more if low rates of return persist in the future, and
higher\-income workers will need to save nearly twice as much in a low return environment compared to the
optimal savings using historical returns.
Blanchett, D. and Finke, M. S. (2019\). “Should Annuities be Purchased from Tax\-Sheltered Assets? ” In:SSRN
e\-Print.
Retirees who purchase an annuity may assume that retirement savings accounts are ideal for funding retirement
income. Annuities, however, are a tax\-favored investment. We investigate the relative benefits of purchasing an
annuity from tax\-deferred and taxable accounts for various payout levels, tax rates, asset tax efficiency, and
assumed portfolio rates of return. We find considerable evidence that investors are better off using non\-qualified
accounts to purchase annuities, although the benefits vary significantly by investor characteristics and the tax
efficiency of investments held in non\-qualified savings. In some cases, selecting the right account increases the
after\-tax income by over 10% which is equivalent to approximately 50 basis points of added portfolio return. A
4015\-year deferred annuity purchased from non\-qualified vs. qualified bonds earning 4% provides over 30% more
after\-tax income for a 65\-year old with a 40% marginal tax rate.
Blanchett, D. and Finke, M. S. (2021\). “Guaranteed Income: A License to Spend .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Prior research finds that retirees don’t spend nearly as much as they could from their investments. Economic
theory provides both rational and behavioral explanations for under\-spending among retirees with high non\-
annuitized wealth. Longevity risk will result in lower spending among rational, risk\-averse retirees. Retirees may
also exhibit behavioral preferences that make them far more comfortable spending from income than assets. We
explore how the composition of retirement assets is related to retirement spending and find that retirees who
hold a higher percentage of their wealth in guaranteed income spend more than retirees whose wealth consists
primarily of non\-annuitized assets. Marginal estimates suggest that investment assets generate about half of the
amount of additional spending as an equal amount of wealth held in guaranteed income. In other words, retirees
will spend twice as much each year in retirement if they shift investment assets into guaranteed income wealth.
The size of the effect suggests that the explanation for under\-spending non\-annuitized savings is likely both a
behavioral and a rational response to longevity risk.

Thereisgrowingempiricalevidencethatriskpreferenceschangebasedonfinancialmarketconditions.Thispaper
explores individual predictors of time varying risk aversion among participants in U.S. defined contribution plans
using a unique dataset with daily responses to a risk tolerance questionnaire. We find that older investors (ages
51\-65\) are more susceptible to time varying risk aversion. Among older investors, variable risk preference was
greatest for participants with the smallest account balances and the lowest incomes, but was unrelated to equity
allocation within their retirement portfolio. Much of the variation in the aggregate risk tolerance score can be
attributed to variation in future long\-term equity performance expectations among older investors. We discuss
how target\-date funds have the potential to reduce losses from poor market timing that may result from time
varying risk aversion.
Blanchett, D., Finke, M. S., and Pfau, W. D. (2016b). “Required Retirement Savings Rates Today .” In:SSRN
e\-Print.
Recent asset pricing studies suggest that demand for stocks since 1980 has driven expected returns below their
historical average. The current yield of risk\-free assets in the U.S. is also well below historical bond yields.
This decrease in bond yields, coupled with increases in longevity, has doubled the cost of funding a real dollar
of income in retirement since 1980 for a 65\-year\-old retiree. Many common financial planning practices are
surprisingly sensitive to asset returns, and advisors need to understand the challenges clients will face if high
asset prices persist. Results from a life cycle planning model show that savings rates would need to rise sharply
for households hoping to maintain the same standard of living in retirement if real asset returns are low. Low
expected returns also have a surprisingly strong impact on the amount of savings needs to fund legacy goals and
a negative impact on client spending throughout their life cycle. Advisors may need to modify expected returns
in planning software to provide clients with more realistic projections on meeting long\-term spending goals.
Blanchett, D. and Kaplan, P. D. (2018\). “Beyond the Glide Path:The Drivers of Target\-Date Fund Returns .” In:
The Journal of Retirement 5(4\), pp. 25–39\.
The authors explore the relative importance of the three primary drivers of target\-date fund (TDF) performance:
equity (or market) exposures (which, across a series vintages, combine to form a glide path), style exposures
(intrastock and intrabond allocations), and other investment selection decisions (e.g., manager selection and the
active/passive decision, as well as any other residual risk exposures). They find that overall equity exposure
drives only about 25% of the variation in returns across TDFs versus approximately 30% for style and 45% for
selection, on average. Consequently, the analysis of the riskiness of a given TDF must be based on more than
the overall weight given to equites.
Blanchett, D. M. (2017\). “The Impact of Guaranteed Income and Dynamic Withdrawals on Safe Initial Withdrawal
Rates.” In:Journal of Financial Planning 30(4\), pp. 42–52\.
Optimal safe initial withdrawal rates can differ significantly across relatively similar retiree household scenarios
and to a much larger extent than has been commonly noted in retirement income research. Important variables
to consider are the amount of guaranteed income, the extent to which the household can adjust consumption, the
risk of the investment portfolio, the return assumptions used for projections, and the degree of income stability
desired by the retiree. Guaranteed income had the largest impact on the estimated safe initial withdrawal rates
among the variables considered. Those withdrawal rates varied by more than 4 percentage points for different
41levels of guaranteed income. Although recent research using forward\-looking returns suggested that 3 percent
is a more appropriate safe initial withdrawal rate for retirees today, this analysis suggested that 4 percent is
likely still a much better starting place for many retirees, although the optimal target varies considerably. For
financial planners using probability of success\-based metrics, targeting a lower success level (e.g., a 75 percent
success rate versus a 95 percent success rate) is likely more appropriate, although the optimal target is highly
dependent on retiree characteristics.
Blanchett, D. M., Finke, M., and Pfau, W. D. (2013\). “Low Bond Yields and Safe Portfolio Withdrawal Rates .” In:
The Journal of Wealth Management 16(2\), pp. 55–62\.
The majority of research on sustainable withdrawal strategies has used either historical rolling time periods or
a stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulation process based on long\-term averages, where the expected return of an
asset class is the same for each year of the simulation. While these approaches may be reasonable to describe
long\-term averages, we believe they are less useful when there is a significant and sustained deviation, such
as the current low bond yield market. This article introduces a model that takes into account current bond
yields and allows them to drift toward a higher value during retirement, using an autoregressive model based
primarily on historical relationships between asset classes. This approach can better replicate the actual bond
returns a current or near retiree can expect during retirement both now and in the future. Using this model, we
find a significant reduction in safe initial withdrawal rates, with a 4 percent initial real withdrawal rate having
approximately a 50 percent probability of success over a 30\-year period. It finds that a retiree who wants a 90
percent probability of achieving a retirement income goal with a 30\-year time horizon and a 40 percent equity
portfolio would only have an initial withdrawal rate of 2\.8 percent. Such a low withdrawal rate would require
42\.9 percent more savings if the retiree wanted to pull the same dollar value out of the portfolio annually as he
or she would get with a 4 percent withdrawal rate from a smaller portfolio.

We compare two contracts for managing systematic longevity risk in retirement: a collective arrangement that
distributes the risk among participants, and a market\-provided annuity contract. We evaluate the contracts’
appeal with respect to the retiree’s welfare, and the viability of the market solution through the financial reward
to the annuity provider’s equityholders. We find that individuals prefer to bear the risk under a collective
arrangement than to insure it with a life insurers’ annuity contract subject to insolvency risk (albeit small).
Under realistic capital provision hypotheses, the annuity provider is incapable of adequately compensating its
equityholders for bearing systematic longevity risk.

Automated financial advising (robo\-advising) has become an established practice in wealth management, yet
very few studies have looked at the cross\-section of the robo\-advisors and the factors explaining the persistent
variability in their portfolio allocation recommendations. Using a sample of 53 advising platforms from the
US and Germany, we show that the underlying algorithms manage to identify different risk profiles, although
42substantial variability is evident even within the same investor types’ groups. The robo\-advisor expertise in a
particular asset class seems to play a significant role, as does the geographical location, while the breadth of the
offered investment choice (number of portfolios) across the robo\-advisors under study does not seem to have an
effect.

In retirement planning, advisors should consider a logical, definitional based framework as convictional where

portfolios and many investors now adopt robo\-advisors to obtain guidance on SP choices. Using data from a large

document three main results. First, default options improve robo\-advice users’ fund choices towards lower\-cost
and more diversified funds. Second, many investors \- also those who previously held all\-equity portfolios \- adhere
tothedefaultassetallocationthatisassociatedwitha50%equityexposure,althoughtheycouldconstructriskier

asset allocation while experienced SP users quickly readjust their equity exposure away from the robo\-advisor’s
recommendation. My results emphasize the power of defaults in all\-digital robo\-advisory services and highlight
how they can improve fund choices while at the same time push investors into unsuitable asset allocations.

Longevity increases and population ageing create challenges for all societal institutions, particularly those pro\-
viding retirement income, health care, and long\-term care services. At the individual level, an obvious question is
how to ensure all retirees have an adequate, secure, stable and predictable lifelong income stream that will allow
them to maintain a target standard of living for however long the individual lives. In this paper we introduce
and discuss the concept of retirement wallet representing the multiple income and service sources individuals
and their families will have to fund for longer lives. We then address the main decumulation risks and options,
including the adoption of a given longevity insurance strategy, of a programmed withdrawal strategy and of an
investment strategy. The main payout options available for allocating assets accumulated in pension plans are
discussed, particularly the role of traditional and innovative investment and longevity risk\-sharing structures.
We provide illustrative results for the price of innovative participating longevity\-linked life annuities (PLLAs)
that link benefits to the dynamics of both a longevity index and an interest rate adjustment factor using Spanish
mortality and financial market data.

Longevity increases and population ageing create challenges for all societal institutions, particularly those pro\-
viding retirement income, healthcare, and long\-term care services. At the individual level, an obvious question
is how to ensure all retirees have an adequate, secure, stable, and predictable lifelong income stream that will

review and discuss the main pension decumulation options by explicitly modelling consumers’ behaviour and
objectives though an objective function based on utility theory accounting for consumption and bequest mo\-
tives and different risk preferences. Using a Monte\-Carlo simulation approach calibrated to US financial market
and mortality data, our results suggest that purchasing a capped participating longevity\-linked life annuity at
retirement including embedded longevity and financial options that allow the annuity provider to periodically
revise annuity payments if observed survivorship and portfolio outcomes deviate from expected (or guaranteed)
values at contract initiation deliver superior welfare results when compared with classical annuitization and
non\-annuitization decumulation strategies.

To assess the importance of inflation risk for nominal Treasury yields, a novel quadratic term structure model
with time\-varying inflation risk is estimated using survey\-based inflation uncertainty. The resulting yield decom\-
position captures very diverse macroeconomic dynamics of inflation and real risk premiums (large and positive
during the 1980s but small and negative post\-2008\) and generates sensible high\-frequency estimates of expected
inflation and real short rates over a long sample. The explicit link between the model\-implied factors and macro
fundamentals reveals that short\- but not long\-run fluctuations are unspanned by yields, consistent with an
interest rate policy unresponsive to transient inflation shocks.

Retirement savings adequacy estimates are often based on the assumption that individuals spend the same
amount every year in retirement, and that the withdrawal rate to fund spending is based on spending down a
percentage of retirement savings. We simulate safe consumption rates and compare the amount that wealthy
retirees are spending to the amount they could safely spend given different asset return assumptions and invest\-
ment portfolio allocations. Retirees in the top quintile of financial wealth are spending nowhere near an amount
that would place them in danger of running out of money. In fact, the average financial assets of wealthy retirees
increased during this time period and most retirees spent less than their income. Setting aside 40% of financial
assets to cover uncertain longevity, medical costs, and bequests still results in a consumption gap as high as
47\.3\.% among higher\-wealth retirees.

A large number of portfolio selection models have appeared in the literature since the pioneering work of

New type of approximate stochastic dominance designed for portfolio selection. Equivalent to minimizing the

One recent and promising strategy for Enhanced Indexation is the selection of portfolios that stochastically
dominate the benchmark. We propose here a new type of approximate stochastic dominance rule which implies
other existing approximate stochastic dominance rules. We then use it to find the portfolio that approximately
stochastically dominates a given benchmark with the best possible approximation. Our model is initially for\-
mulated as a Linear Program with exponentially many constraints, and then reformulated in a more compact
manner so that it can be very efficiently solved in practice. This reformulation also reveals an interesting finan\-
cial interpretation. We compare our approach with several exact and approximate stochastic dominance models

models.” In:SSRN e\-Print .
We propose a novel, and simple, Bayesian estimation and model selection procedure for cross\-sectional asset
pricing. Our approach, that allows for both tradable and non\-tradable factors, and is applicable to high dimen\-
sional cases, has several desirable properties. First, weak and spurious factors lead to diffuse, and centered at
zero, posteriors for their market price of risk, making such factors easily detectable. Second, posterior inference is
robust to the presence of such factors. Third, we show that flat priors for risk premia lead to improper marginal
likelihoods, rendering model selection invalid. Therefore, we provide a novel prior, that is diffuse for strong
factors but shrinks away useless ones, under which posterior probabilities are well behaved, and can be used
for factor and (non necessarily nested) model selection, as well as model averaging, in large scale problems. We
apply our method to a very large set of factors proposed in the literature, and analyse 2\.25 quadrillion possible
models, gaining novel insights on the empirical drivers of asset returns.

over passive management. Most conflicts are economic in nature, but some are steeped in intellectual hubris. In
this article the authors enter the fray from the plan participants’ (PPs) side. Ultimately, the very essence of a
DCP is to offer a menu of investment options that enable PPs to optimize wealth aggregation in a diversified
manner using a multiasset class solution. We show that PPs are better served when fiduciaries monitor active
investment managers and replace them with passive alternatives in a timely manner if they underperform. Too
often plan fiduciaries churn a DCP by replacing underperforming active funds with other active funds.

We analyze the problem that fiduciaries face when monitoring and selecting from a universe of active mutual
funds within a defined contribution (DC) plan. In a DC plan, a fiduciary must recognize that there are two levels
of decision makers, namely the fiduciary, who decides which funds will comprise the DC plan and the individual
plan participants, who must decide which funds to invest in and the timing of their investment. Moreover, plan
participants, and to some degree the fiduciary, need to be able to make investment decisions without being
investment professionals. We find that due to the general lack of consistency in performance of mutual funds,
fiduciaries and plan participants would be better served by selecting passive rather than active funds across the
US equity mutual fund space. Moreover, the most consistently outperforming funds tend to have meaningfully
higher tracking errors relative to their stated benchmarks, which makes effective asset allocation in a DC plan
more difficult.

Strategies .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
This article sets out principles and decision rules for setting appropriate drawdown and investment strategies
during retirement given an individual’s objectives and risk tolerance. In particular, we highlight how the suitable
drawdown strategy can relate to the objective, and how annuities might be combined with other investments
to help manage risk. Our aim is to offer research\-based guidance to product providers, financial advisers and
individuals in formulating retirement strategies.
Cairns, A. J. G., Blake, D., Dowd, K., and Coughlan, G. (2020\). “A Two\-Factor Model for Stochastic Mortality
with Parameter Uncertainty: Theory and Calibration .” In:SSRN e\-Print (s).
We use a case study of a pension plan wishing to hedge the longevity risk in its pension liabilities at a future
date. The plan has the choice of using either a customised hedge or an index hedge, with the degree of hedge
effectiveness being closely related to the correlation between the value of the hedge and the value of the pension
liability. The key contribution of this paper is to show how correlation and, therefore, hedge effectiveness can
be broken down into contributions from a number of distinct types of risk factors. Our decomposition of the
correlation indicates that population basis risk has a significant influence on the correlation. But recalibration
risk as well as the length of the recalibration window are also important, as is cohort effect uncertainty. Having
accounted for recalibration risk, additional parameter uncertainty has only a marginal impact on hedge effec\-
tiveness. Finally, the inclusion of Poisson risk only starts to become significant when the smaller population falls
45below about 10,000 members over age 50\. Our case study shows that, at least for medium and large pension
plans, longevity risk can be substantially hedged using index hedges as an alternative to customised longevity
hedges. As a consequence, when the hedger’s population involves more than about 10,000 members over age 50,
index longevity hedges (in conjunction with the other components of an ALM strategy) can provide an effective
and lower cost alternative to both a full buy\-out of pension liabilities or even to a strategy using customised
longevity hedges.

In:Journal of Financial Economics 143(1\), pp. 188–206\.
We show that reaching for yield\-a tendency to take more risk when the real interest rate declines while the risk
premium remains constant\-results from imposing a sustainable spending constraint on an otherwise standard
infinitely lived investor with power utility. When the interest rate is initially low, reaching for yield intensifies.
The sustainable spending constraint also affects the response of risk\-taking to a change in the risk premium,
which can even change sign. In a variant of the model where the sustainable spending constraint is formulated
in nominal terms, low inflation also encourages risk\-taking.

inflation using alternative long\-memory approaches .” In:Empirical economics 58, pp. 1491–1511\.
We consider two important features of the historical US price data (1774\-2015\), namely the data persistence and
cyclical structure. We first consider the persistence of the series and focus on standard long\-memory models that
incorporate a peak at the zero frequency. We examine different models with respect to the deterministic terms,
including nonlinear deterministic trends of the Chebyshev form. Then, we investigate a more general model that
includes both persistence and cyclicality of the series and, thus, includes two fractional integration parameters,
one at the zero (long\-run) frequency and the other at the nonzero (cyclical) frequency. We model the cyclical
structure as a Gegenbauer process. This specification outperforms the standard long\-memory specifications. We
find that the order of integration at the zero frequency is about 0\.5, and the one at the cyclical frequency is about
0\.2 with cycles repeating approximately every 6 years, producing mean\-reverting long\-memory effects at both
the zero and cyclical frequencies. Fitting the values to this model, however, we discover the presence of a break
that, according to the methods employed, takes place at around 1940\-1941\. The results indicate the prevalence
of the long\-run or zero component with a much higher degree of persistence during the second post\-1940\-1941
subsample, suggesting important implications for monetary policy.

through Client Interaction .” In:arXiv e\-Print .
Automated investment managers, or robo\-advisors, have emerged as an alternative to traditional financial advi\-
sors. The viability of robo\-advisors crucially depends on their ability to offer personalized financial advice. We
introduce a novel framework, in which a robo\-advisor interacts with a client to solve an adaptive mean\-variance
portfolio optimization problem. The risk\-return tradeoff adapts to the client’s risk profile, which depends on
idiosyncratic characteristics, market returns, and economic conditions. We show that the optimal investment
strategy includes both myopic and intertemporal hedging terms which are impacted by the dynamics of the
client’s risk profile. We characterize the optimal portfolio personalization via a tradeoff faced by the robo\-advisor
between receiving client information in a timely manner and mitigating behavioral biases in the risk profile com\-
municated by the client. We argue that the optimal portfolio’s Sharpe ratio and return distribution improve if
the robo\-advisor counters the client’s tendency to reduce market exposure during economic contractions when
the market risk\-return tradeoff is more favorable.

the efficiency of the portfolio, whereas a higher standard deviation reduces the efficiency of the portfolio. We
find that affluent and financially educated investors as well as those holding retirement related accounts hold
more efficient portfolios.

The performance of any retirement plan needs to be gauged against an appropriately chosen benchmark. We

of investors. For example, the S\&P 500 is a poor benchmark to use when investors are five years from retirement.
Given the importance of income to retirees, a benchmark for decumulation should be based on matching assets
to liabilities or planned spending, and it should minimize longevity, investment, counterparty, and liquidity risks.
We give an example of a decumulation benchmark, which is based on a strategy of holding TIPS and deferred
life annuities. This is a call to action: Only by adopting the best practice of choosing and using an appropriate
benchmark for retirement portfolios\-accumulation and decumulation\-can fiduciaries execute the responsibility
they have agreed to take on.
Cesarone, F., Moretti, J., and Tardella, F. (2018\). “Why Small Portfolios Are Preferable and How to Choose Them .”
In:SSRN e\-Print .
One of the fundamental principles in portfolio selection models is minimization of risk through diversification of
the investment. However, this principle does not necessarily translate into a request for investing in all the assets
of the investment universe. Indeed, following a line of research started by Evans and Archer almost 50 years
ago, we provide here further evidence that small portfolios are sufficient to achieve almost optimal in\-sample
risk reduction with respect to variance and to some other popular risk measures, and very good out\-of\-sample
performances. While leading to similar results, our approach is significantly different from the classical one
pioneered by Evans and Archer. Indeed, we describe models for choosing the portfolio of a prescribed size with
the smallest possible risk, as opposed to the random portfolio choice investigated in most of the previous works.
We find that the smallest risk portfolios generally require no more than 15 assets. Furthermore, it is almost
always possible to find portfolios that are just 1% more risky than the smallest risk portfolios and contain no
more than 10 assets. The preference for small optimal portfolios is also justified by recent theoretical results on
the estimation errors for the parameters required by portfolio selection models. Our empirical analysis is based
on some new and on some publicly available benchmark data sets often used in the literature.

One of the main issues in portfolio selection models consists in assessing the effect of the estimation errors of the
parameters required by the models on the quality of the selected portfolios. Several studies have been devoted to
this topic for the minimum variance and for several other minimum risk models. However, no sensitivity analysis
seems to have been reported for the recent popular Risk Parity diversification approach, nor for other portfolio
selection models requiring maximum gain\-risk ratios.Based on artificial and real\-world data, we provide here
empirical evidence showing that the Risk Parity model is always the most stable one in all the cases analyzed.
Furthermore, the minimum risk models are typically more stable than the maximum gain\-risk models, with the
minimum variance model often being the preferable one.

The benefit of investment advice depends on the quality of advice and the investor’s counterfactual portfolio.
We use changes in the Oregon University System Optional Retirement Plan to highlight the impact of plan
design on the counterfactual portfolios of advice seekers. When brokers are available and target date funds
(TDFs) are not, brokers help participants with high predicted demand for advice bear market risk, but they
recommend higher\-commission options. When brokers are removed and TDFs are added, new high\-predicted\-
47demand participants primarily invest in TDFs, which offer similar market risk but higher Sharpe ratios than the
broker\-advised portfolios within our sample.

Because there are more and more older people in Taiwan, how retirees can maintain their past consumption

retirement. Because factors such as investment performance, risk, and taxation must be considered in making
investment policy choices, the authors apply the analytic hierarchy process (Satty \[1980]) to design a framework
for evaluating individual investment policy performance. The research findings show that the most important
criterion is investment performance. These results provide some suggestions for retirement planning.

financial portfolios .” In:Journal of Banking \& Finance 124 (106028\).
We investigate how savings goals relate to wealth allocation and how this relationship is moderated by financial
advice and numerical ability. Using panel data from a large household survey we find that as the number and
the time horizon of savings goals increases, portfolios shift from safe assets to both fairly safe assets and risky
assets. We also find that households with access to multiple sources of financial advice and independent financial
advice hold more fairly safe and risky assets and that independent financial advice enhances the influence of
savings goals on wealth allocation to fairly safe and risky assets. Overall we find that the possession of savings
goals is associated with long term saving activity, and this is particularly evident for those with low levels
of numerical ability. By enabling the formation of savings goals, the financial planning process can facilitate
long\-term investment in risky assets.

The value added by an active investor is traditionally measured using alpha, tracking error, and the information
ratio. However, these measures do not characterize the dynamic component of investor activity, nor do they
consider the time horizons over which weights are changed. In this paper, we propose a technique to measure the
valueofactiveinvestmentthatcapturesboththestaticanddynamiccontributionsofaninvestmentprocess.This
dynamicalphaisbasedonthedecompositionofaportfolio’sexpectedreturnintoitsfrequencycomponentsusing

resulting from passive investments and security selection and a dynamic component that captures the manager’s
timing ability across a range of time horizons. Our framework can be universally applied to any portfolio and
is a useful method for comparing the forecast power of different investment processes. Several analytical and
empirical examples are provided to illustrate the practical relevance of this decomposition.

annuities .” In:Annals of Actuarial Science , pp. 1–27\.
In most industrialised countries, one of the major societal challenges is the demographic change coming along
with the ageing of the population. The increasing life expectancy observed over the last decades underlines the
importance to find ways to appropriately cover the financial needs of the elderly. A particular issue arises in the
area of health, where sufficient care must be provided to a growing number of dependent elderly in need of long\-
term care (LTC) services. In many markets, the offering of life insurance products incorporating care options and
LTC insurance products is generally scarce. In our research, we therefore examine a life annuity product with
an embedded care option potentially providing additional financial support to dependent persons. To evaluate
the care option, we determine the minimum price that the annuity provider requires and the policyholder’s
willingness to pay for the care option. For the latter, we employ individual utility functions taking account of
the policyholder’s condition. We base our numerical study on recently developed transition probability data
from Switzerland. Our findings give new and realistic insights into the nature and the utility of life annuity
products proposing an embedded care option for tackling the financing of LTC needs.

Many empirical studies confirm that policyholder’s subjective mortality beliefs deviate from the information
given by publicly available mortality tables. In this study, we look at the effect of subjective mortality beliefs on
the perceived attractiveness of retirement products, focusing on two extreme products, conventional annuities
(where the insurance company takes the longevity risk) and tontines (where a pool of policyholders shares
the longevity risk). If risk loadings and charges are neglected, a standard expected utility framework, without
48subjective mortality beliefs, leads to the conclusion that annuities are always preferred to tontines (Yaari (1965\),
Milevsky and Salisbury (2015\)). In the same setting, we show that this result is easily reversed if an individual
perceives her peer’s life expectancies to be lower than the ones used by the insurance company. We prove that,
assumingsuchsubjectivebeliefs,thereexistsacriticaltontinepoolsizefromwhichthetontineisalwayspreferred

standard expected utility theory without subjective mortality beliefs.
Chen, A., Li, H., and Schultze, M. B. (2022b). “Tail index\-linked annuity: A longevity risk sharing retirement plan .”
In:Scandinavian Actuarial Journal , pp. 1–26\.
This paper proposes an innovative retirement product focusing on longevity risk sharing, a contract we refer
to as tail index\-linked annuity (TILA). Specifically, the proposed TILA pays out variable annual payments,
which will be equal to a regular nominal amount when a reference survival index is lower than a predetermined
threshold (i.e. normal evolution of longevity risk), and a reduced, index\-dependent payment when the threshold
is passed (i.e. highly unfavorable evolution of longevity risk). The proposed TILA aims at not only improving
the benefits of the policyholders, which has been the focus in recent literature on innovative retirement products,
but also reducing the longevity risk exposure of the insurer, particularly for advanced retirement ages. Using
real\-world mortality data and a stochastic multi\-population mortality model, we find that the proposed TILA
leads to higher expected lifetime utility than regular annuities for policyholders with different degrees of risk
aversions. Meanwhile, numerical analysis shows that the proposed TILA could greatly mitigate the solvency risk
of the insurer, leading to a substantially lower loss probability and expected (tail\-) loss than regular annuities
in the presence of a longevity shock, and therefore could reduce the insurer’s required solvency capital under
the latest solvency regulations.
Chen, A., Rach, M., and Sehner, T. (2019\). “On the Optimal Combination of Annuities and Tontines .” In:SSRN
e\-Print.
Tontines, retirement products constructed in such a way that the longevity risk is shared in a pool of policyhold\-
ers, have recently gained vast attention from researchers and practitioners. Typically, these products are cheaper
than annuities, but do not provide stable payments to policyholders. This raises the question whether, from the
policyholders’ viewpoint, the advantages of annuities and tontines can be combined to form a retirement plan
which is cheaper than an annuity and carries less risk than a tontine. In this article, we analyze and compare
three approaches of combining annuities and tontines in an expected utility framework: The introduced in Chen
et al. (2019\), a product very similar to the tonuity which we call and a portfolio consisting of an annuity and
a tontine. We show that the payoffs of a tonuity or an antine can be replicated by a portfolio consisting of
an annuity and a tontine. Consequently, policyholders achieve higher expected utility levels when choosing the
portfolio over the novel retirement products tonuity and antine.
Chen, A. and Munnell, A. H. (2021\). How Much Taxes Will Retirees Owe on Their Retirement Income? Tech. rep.
Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
To evaluate their retirement resources, households approaching retirement will examine their Social Security
statements, defined benefit pensions, defined contribution balances, and other financial assets. However, many
households may forget that not all of these resources belong to them; they will need to pay some portion to
federal and state government in taxes. It is unclear, however, just how large the tax burden is for the typical
retired household and for households with different income levels. This project aims to shed light on the tax
burdens that retirees face by estimating lifetime taxes for a group of recently retired households. The project
uses data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) linked to administrative earnings to determine Social
Security benefits and administrative records on state of residence to estimate state tax liabilities. Income is then
projected over the expected retirement of each household. Federal and state taxes, are estimated with TAXSIM,
for each household on its reported and projected income.
The paper found that:
•These estimates show that households in the aggregate will have to pay about 6 percent of their income in
federal and state income taxes.
•But this liability rests primarily with the top quintile of the income distribution.
•For the lowest four quintiles, taxes are negligible \- ranging from 0 percent to 1\.9 percent.
•In contrast, the average liability is 3 percent for the top quintile, 16\.4 percent for the top 5 percent, and
22\.7 percent for the top 1 percent.

nuitisation decisions .” In:Journal of Pension Economics and Finance 19(3\), pp. 372–391\.
The low demand for immediate annuities at retirement has been a long\-standing puzzle. We show that a hyper\-
bolic discount model can explain this behaviour and results in the attractiveness of long\-term deferred annuities.
With a set of benchmark assumptions, we find that retirees would be willing to pay a much higher price than
the actuarial fair price for annuities with longer deferred periods. Moreover, if governments were to introduce
a pre\-commitment device which requires pensioners to make annuitisation decisions around 10 years before
retirement, the take up rate of annuities could become higher.

In this paper, we integrate investment decisions in the post\-retirement decumulation period with that of the
deferred annuity purchase to provide a lifetime decumulation solution. Based on Monte Carlo simulation and
historical experience, we use the Perfect Withdrawal Rate (PWR) as a tool to make recommendations on
withdrawal rates and asset allocations for different levels of risk preferences. We have a few potentially important
findings. First, we illustrate how cheap it is to use a deferred annuity (especially with a deferred period of more
than 15 years) as a solution to deal with longevity risk and maintain control of retirement wealth with the
investor. Second, we find that if an individual wants to maximise median PWR, he/she should allocate almost
100% in stocks regardless of the length of chosen decumulation period. If an individual wants to maximise
minimum PWR, he/she should allocate around 40% \- 60% in stocks; therefore, a substantial stocks component
should be maintained even if the individual is very risk averse. This then links to our final conclusion on a
re\-defined Glidepath: if an individual can accept a lower than 50% risk of failure, he/she should move from
stocks to bonds as he/she becomes older; however a certain percentage in stocks should be maintained through
the decumulation phase.

Assuming a world where deferred annuities are available, we propose two utility maximising decumulation

the commencement of the annuity. A retiree who is concerned about longevity risk and wants to retain a certain

bequest motive.
Chen,W.andLangrene,N.(2020\). “Deepneuralnetworkforoptimalretirementconsumptionindefinedcontribution
pension system .” In:arXiv e\-Print .
In this paper, we develop a deep neural network approach to solve a lifetime expected mortality\-weighted utility\-
based model for optimal consumption in the decumulation phase of a defined contribution pension system. We
formulate this problem as a multi\-period finite\-horizon stochastic control problem and train a deep neural
network policy representing consumption decisions. The optimal consumption policy is determined by personal
information about the retiree such as age, wealth, risk aversion and bequest motive, as well as a series of
economic and financial variables including inflation rates and asset returns jointly simulated from a proposed
seven\-factor economic scenario generator calibrated from market data. We use the Australian pension system as
an example, with consideration of the government\-funded means\-tested Age Pension and other practical aspects
such as fund management fees. The key findings from our numerical tests are as follows. First, our deep neural
network optimal consumption policy, which adapts to changes in market conditions, outperforms deterministic
drawdown rules proposed in the literature. Moreover, the out\-of\-sample outperformance ratios increase as the
number of training iterations increases, eventually reaching outperformance on all testing scenarios after less
than 10 minutes of training. Second, a sensitivity analysis is performed to reveal how risk aversion and bequest
motives change the consumption over a retiree’s lifetime under this utility framework. Third, we provide the
50optimal consumption rate with different starting wealth balances. We observe that optimal consumption rates
are not proportional to initial wealth due to the Age Pension payment. Forth, with the same initial wealth
balance and utility parameter settings, the optimal consumption level is different between males and females
due to gender differences in mortality.

results show that retirees on average do not spend their time significantly different throughout retirement. Most
life tasks such as reading the paper or magazines, listening to music, playing sports or exercising, visiting others,

Equity\-indexed annuities (EIAs) are popular products that eliminate the downside risk while still providing
upside potential. Among the three major categories of EIAs, ratchet EIAs are the most popular. Ratchet EIAs
with quanto features emerge due to differences in asset returns across countries. The literature covers the pricing
of the EIAs that are not quantos, and this paper fills the hole. In deriving pricing formulas, we add an exchange
rate model as well as a foreign risk\-free rate model to the pricing framework of Black and Scholes. Our formulas
cover quanto ratchet EIAs for both compound and simple versions that may have a return cap and employ
two types of geometric return averaging. The numerical analyses illustrate how contract features and market
parameters affect contract values. The results also highlight the significance of quantos in contract pricing.

The Journal of Retirement 8(1\), pp. 65–79\.
The authors discuss the nature and importance of the concept of sequence risk, the risk that a bad return
occurs at a particularly unfortunate time, such as around the point of maximum accumulation or the start of
decumulation. This concept is especially relevant in the context of retirement savings, where the implications for
withdrawal rates of a bad return can be particularly severe. They show how the popular glidepath or target\-date
savings products are very exposed to such risk. Three different measures of sequence risk are proposed, each of
which is intended to inform investors of the probability that a chosen investment strategy may not deliver desired
withdrawal rates, and hence these measures are intended to aid investment choices; conventional performance
measures such as Sharpe or Sortino ratios are only indirectly related to this ability to achieve a given withdrawal
experience. Finally, the authors note that, using US data, very simple portfolios comprising equities and bonds
can achieve very low probabilities of failure to achieve popular desired withdrawal rates, such as 5% a year, as
long as the equity component is smoothed by switching in and out of cash using a simple trend\-following rule.

Lessons with and without Annuities while in Drawdown between 2000 and 2019 .” In:The Journal of Retirement

This article shows how the relatively new concept of Perfect Withdrawal Rate can be used in assessing the
appropriate sustainable withdrawal amounts from a pot of wealth. This concept can be applied equally to
private retirement funds, endowments, and charities \- and indeed in any context requiring regular withdrawals
from an initial source of funds. The subject of estimating sustainable withdrawal rates usually falls back on
describing the likely minimum safe withdrawal possibilities for various portfolio constructions over different
decumulation periods. This analysis employs either a long period of historical data or a recombination of data
in the form of Monte Carlo simulations. To illustrate the power of the Perfect Withdrawal concept, the article
considers the case of someone who initiated retirement on January 1, 2000, at age 65 and, with the benefit

this experience. The article also introduces the concept and a methodology for purchasing a delayed annuity so
that at age 85 (on December 31, 2019\), the hypothetical retiree is fully transitioned from investment income to
annuity income for the rest of their life, no matter how long that may be.

Rates and Glidepath Investing in US Retirement Portfolios from 1925 .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
A significant part of the development in pension provision in many countries is the emergence of Date Funds or
TDFs.Inthispaperweexaminethepropositionofde\-riskingthroughlifeandtheguidanceofferedbyTDFsinthe
decumulation phase following retirement. We investigate the withdrawal experience associated with Glidepath
Investing in the US since 1925 for conventional bond\-equity portfolios. We find one very powerful conclusion:
that smoothing the returns on individual assets by simple absolute momentum or trend following techniques is
a potent tool to enhance withdrawal rates, often by as much as 50% per annum! And, perhaps of even greater
social relevance is that it removes the \-tail of unfortunate withdrawal rate experiences, i.e. the bad luck of a
poor sequence of returns early in decumulation. We show that diversifying assets over time by switching between
an asset and cash in a systematic way is potentially more important for the retirement income experience than
diversifying one portfolio across asset classes. We also show that Glidepath investing is only sensible within a
few years of the target date. This finding provides succour to enthusiasts for target date investing in the face of
the growing hostility in the literature.

the returns on individual assets by simple trend following techniques is a potent tool to enhance withdrawal
rates.Second, we show that while diversification across asset classes does lead to higher withdrawal rates than
simple equity/bond portfolios, ”smoothing” returns in itself is far more powerful a tool for raising withdrawal
rates. In fact,smoothing the popular equity/bond portfolios (such as the 60/40 portfolio) is in itself an excellent
and simple solution to constructing a retirement portfolio. Alternatively, trend following enables portfolios
to contain more risky assets, and the greater upside they offer, for the same level of overall risk compared to

plans: the curious case of social security leveling .” In:The Journal of Retirement 6(1\), pp. 33–44\.
Social Security Leveling is an annuity option that allows defined benefit pension participants to receive a level
income throughout retirement by taking a larger pension benefit before they reach Social Security eligibility.
This option can enable retirees to access a greater proportion of their employer pension wealth at younger ages
and have a smoother income stream in retirement, at the cost of a lower pension payment during later retirement
years. To evaluate the desirability of this option, a retiree must consider pricing, anticipated life expectancy, and
income needs throughout retirement. We show that plan design features of this annuity option favor those who
expect a shorter\-than\-average period of retirement and who have higher personal discount rates. This study uses
detailed administrative records on all North Carolina state and local government retirees from 2009 through
2014\. Among individuals claiming retirement benefits before age 62, over 20% chose the Social Security Leveling
annuity option. Using multivariate regression analysis, this study finds evidence that North Carolina public
sector retirees choose the Social Security Leveling option in a manner that is consistent with predictions.

Adequately sustaining lifetime income is a critical portfolio objective for retired investors. This article provides
a brief review of various retirement income modeling approaches including historical back testing, Monte Carlo

8(1\).
In the process of evaluating various retirement income strategies, it appears that, for investors not endowed with
substantial wealth relative to consumption demands, sequence of returns risk is operative throughout retirement.
We explore, in an asset\-liability modeling context, the reasons why sequence risk exists throughout the planning
horizon and why it can be particularly acute at the end of an investor’s life span. Given the nature of this risk,
prudent asset management benefits from developing appropriate risk metrics, and from implementing credible
monitoring, evaluation, and communication procedures. Two case studies focus on sequence of returns risk. They
present risk metrics designed to answer the following questions: (1\) is the investor’s retirement income strategy
feasible; (2\) if yes, is it sustainable; and (3\) does it allow sufficient flexibility to provide security in the face
of financial shocks? The risk metrics employ information derived from both investment simulation models and
actuarial calculations.

The industry of online personal financial services is expected over the next years to absorb an increasing share of
households and individuals’ savings and investment decisions with a parallel expansion of tailored decision tools
53and underlying methodological developments. In this article we present a dynamic stochastic optimisation model
formulated to tackle a long\-term optimal wealth management problem\-based explicitly on the introduction of
consumption and investment goals with a terminal inflation\-adjusted retirement target. By embedding a goal\-
based investing philosophy in a dynamic framework we provide a reference modelling approach for increasingly

programming formulation will lead to a highly realistic representation and solution of an otherwise hardly
manageable optimisation problem and it is consistent with computer\-aided decision support tools’ operational
requirements.

asset liability management .” In:IMA Journal of Management Mathematics 23(4\), pp. 365–396\.
Increasing financial pressure on State\-controlled pension systems has caused, over the last two decades or so, an
unprecedented effort by private pension funds (PFs) and insurance companies to issue new types of retirement
vehicles. This article investigates the effects of such widespread phenomenon from the perspective of individual
asset liability management. A multistage stochastic programming problem has been formulated with investment
opportunities including PFs, unit\-linked contracts and variable life annuities. The introduction of a specific
risk measure with respect to a desirable retirement income stream and a planning horizon spanning the entire
individuals’ working life helps to analyse the implications of observed market dynamics on retirement strategies.
We present comparative results focusing on the retirement planning problem for three representative individuals
carrying different time horizons but common retirement goals. The results show the benefits over traditional
pension accumulation plans of dynamic strategies based on mixed portfolios of retirement products.

investors .” In:Annals of Operations Research 152(1\), pp. 167–191\.
We develop a scenario optimization model for asset and liability management of individual investors. The
individual has a given level of initial wealth and a target goal to be reached within some time horizon. The
individual must determine an asset allocation strategy so that the portfolio growth rate will be sufficient to
reach the target. A scenario optimization model is formulated which maximizes the upside potential of the
portfolio, with limits on the downside risk. Both upside and downside are measured vis\-a\-vis the goal. The
stochastic behavior of asset returns is captured through bootstrap simulation, and the simulation is embedded
in the model to determine the optimal portfolio. Post\-optimality analysis using out\-of\-sample scenarios measures
the probability of success of a given portfolio. It also allows us to estimate the required increase in the initial
endowment so that the probability of success is improved.

pectancy: a scenario analysis of the Italian longevity experience .” In:The Journal of Risk Finance 21(3\), pp. 217–
231\.
Purpose This paper aims to measure the financial impact on social security system of a recently proposed index\-
ation mechanism for retirement age by considering the Italian longevity experience. The analysis is motivated by
the progressive increase in life expectancy at advanced age, which is rapidly bringing to the fore noticeable socio\-
economic consequences in most industrialized countries. Among those, the impact on National Social Security
systems is particularly relevant if people live longer than expected; this will lead to greater financial exposure for
pension providers. Design/methodology/approach Referring to the Italian population for illustrative purposes,
the authors contemplate different scenarios for mortality projection methods and for the implementation of
pension age shift while accounting for gender and cohort gaps and model risk. Synthetic indicators to measure
the impact of the indexation mechanism on social security system are introduced on the basis of pension cash
flows. Findings An indexation policy that manages gender gap while adjusting retirement age for varying life ex\-
pectancy is proposed. As a result, sustainability of public retirement expenditure is improved. Originality/value
The paper is a concise scenario analysis of the reduction of costs and risks that pension providers would have
if the system resorted to link retirement age to life expectancy. The ideas fostered by the paper follow a recent
proposal of the Authors on a flexible retirement scheme that deals with model risk for mortality projection and
accounts for gender gap in mortality rates.

Until an elderly relative suddenly needs long\-term care and cannot afford to pay for it, most Americans do
not appreciate how difficult the Medicaid legal system is to navigate. With long\-term services ranging from a
median monthly average of USD1,473 for limited services to USD7,698 for comprehensive services, providing
54long\-term care for a loved one forces the majority of Americans to apply for Medicaid benefits. Many individuals
find themselves trapped to transfer any of their estate prior to applying for Medicaid because of the five\-year
lookback penalty. This article discusses seven estate planning steps that will help individuals protect their net
worth while also securing eligibility for Medicaid benefits.
Cosares, S. (2013\). “Generating a Family of Optimal Glide Paths for Investment Planning with Target Dates .” In:
The Journal of Wealth Management 16(3\), pp. 43–53\.
The article presents an optimization model for an approach to financial planning whereby investment decisions
over time follow a (decreasing) glide path. With this strategy, an investment advisor would recommend riskier
assets for the immediate future in order to take advantage of their larger expected returns. The author presumes
that, over time, the proportion of more conservative investments in the portfolio will increase. Thus, it is likely
to achieve expected investment\-gain targets while reducing the risk of severe losses in wealth at the time when
the money is actually needed (the target dates). There are a number of benefits to front\-loading investment risk
in this way, even though it comes with an increase in overall risk, as measured by the variance in the random
variable representing total accumulated wealth. To accommodate varying objectives among investors regarding
this trade\-off, the model includes a parameter for glide\-path intensity that allows the investor to select the level
of deviation from the risk\-minimizing solution, which would tend to recommend investments having roughly
the same risk return level for every year in the planning horizon (i.e., a straight\-line strategy). The model then
focuses on the traditional multi\-goal and multitime\-horizon problem and uses simulations to demonstrate the
benefits associated with a flexible implementation of the glide\-path strategy that further minimizes the risk of
missing a goal.

Tech. rep. Vanguard.
Followers of the F.I.R.E. movement\-Financial Independence Retire Early\-have long relied on the ”4% rule”
to determine what they can withdraw from their portfolios over perhaps 40 or 50 years in retirement. The
4% rule, however, was originally designed for investors with a 30\-year retirement horizon. And the simplifying
assumptions it embeds about future returns, diversification, and fees can limit a retirement plan’s viability
over both shorter and longer horizons. Using Vanguard’s principles for investing success, this research paper
illustrates how F.I.R.E. investors can improve their chances of financing an early retirement.

of Wealth Management 18(3\), pp. 18–26\.
In general, households use old technology for asset allocation decisions. Target\-risk portfolio models are pervasive
across the industry, and risk\-profile questionnaires continue to form the foundation for strategic asset allocation
decision\-making. Better technology would utilize liability relative optimization and a holistic balance sheet
and incorporate behavioral finance considerations. However, these concepts have not been integrated into most
practitioners’ businesses, even though the core work on each was completed 20\-30 years ago. The authors
propose a scalable, total wealth model for integrating liability relative optimization into households’ portfolios.
The basis for the model is an asset segmentation approach that refl ects the nuances of a households’ balance
sheet and future objectives and enables liability relative optimization and total wealth considerations to be
applied appropriately.
Crook, M. and Sutedja, R. (2017\). “Will Long\-Term Care Ruin Retirement Plans? ” In:The Journal of Retirement
4(3\), pp. 42–50\.
Long\-term care expenses represent a known unknown in retirement planning. A large majority of households
will need some sort of long\-term care support as they age, and costs for certain types of long\-term care, like
nursing homes, can run over USD100,000 per year. However, most families will not incur expenses of this order.
Who is at risk? We use a simulation\-based framework to analyze how often long\-term care expenses are likely
to cause ruin in an otherwise prudently constructed financial plan. Our framework also enables us to estimate
long\-term care usage by type of service and calculate a distribution of total care costs for a particular household.
We find that roughly 85% of older couples will utilize long\-term care. Long\-term care expenses impact financial
plan sustainability at a declining rate as wealth increases from USD1 million to USD10 million. At a portfolio
value of USD1 million, adding long\-term care expenses to the simulation results in ruin (defined as depleting
the portfolio entirely prior to the death of both members of the couple) about 30% of the time. With certain
caveats discussed in the article, we estimate that failure rates increase by 9 percentage points for USD5 million
households, and increase by about 5 percentage points for USD10 million households. We also find that female
same\-sexhouseholdsareparticularlyatriskduetogreaterlongevityandhigherincidenceoflong\-termcareusage.
55In summary, financial plans that do not incorporate long\-term care expenses can significantly overestimate the
long\-term sustainability of the plan.
Crook,M.W.(2019\). “LiabilitiesMatter:ImprovingTargetDateGlidepathConstructionthroughLiabilityAdaptive
Asset Allocation .” In:The Journal of Retirement 7(1\), pp. 44–57\.
Target date glidepath funds have become extraordinarily popular in defined contribution plans during the
past decade. Most glidepath strategies are based, fundamentally, on the idea that investors have bond\-like
human capital that slowly depletes during their career, and therefore investors should complement their human
capital depletion with a declining equity glidepath as they progress toward retirement. Despite the theoretical
attractiveness, the human capital approach unfortunately falls flat from an empirical and practical standpoint.
In this article the author proposes a new liability\-adaptive approach for target date glidepath construction. By
moving away from a human capital approach and instead focusing on future retirement liabilities, the author
shows that plan sponsors can improve outcomes for participants. The author also believes this framework enables
sponsors to better communicate the underlying assumptions in their glidepath offering to participants who are
planning for retirement. Finally, the author shows how financial advisors can use the same framework with
individual investors and families to improve outcomes on a customized basis.

drawdowns .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
We propose an approach to portfolio selection that explicitly takes into account investors simultaneous in\-
vestment objectives, such as achieving target return levels and avoiding specific drawdowns. Our approach is
consistent with both standard and non\-standard risk preferences, such as those of prospect theory. Instead of
asking the investor to choose between lotteries, transforming this into an estimate of the risk preferences, and
then selecting the portfolio accordingly, we propose to directly offer investors a choice between lotteries” with
varying probabilities of experiencing target levels of profits and losses. Our approach enables investors to flexibly
assess the effectiveness of portfolio choices under various conditions. We discuss implementation considerations
and compare our approach to traditional mean\-variance portfolio selection.

Traditional forms of robo\-advice were targeted to help individuals make portfolio allocation decisions. Based on
the balance\-sheet view of households, the scope for robo\-advising has been expanding to many other personal\-

management, and lending. This chapter reviews existing research on these new functions of robo\-advising with a
special emphasis on the questions that are still open for researchers across several disciplines. We also discuss the
attempts to optimize jointly all personal\-finance decisions, which we label ”holistic robo\-advisors”. We conclude
by assessing fruitful avenues for research and practice in finance, computer science, marketing, decision science,

We give a numerical algorithm based on the policy iteration method to find approximations of solution of
an HJB equation arising from the portfolio optimization problem post retirement for a member of a defined
contribution plan. In our numerical algorithm, we apply a fully implicit finite difference scheme to the HJB
equation on a bounded domain. In formulating the optimal control problem, the loss function is written using
a target function during the decumulation phase and at the terminal time. Following Di Giacinto et al. (2014\),
a minimum guarantee for the final annuity is considered. Finally, we give the simulation results for the final
annuity, optimal investment strategy and optimal wealth process, for different levels of risk aversion and different
loss functions.
Dadashi, H. (2020b). “Optimal investment–consumption problem: Post\-retirement with minimum guarantee .” In:
Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 94, pp. 160–181\.
We study the optimal investment\-consumption problem for a member of defined contribution plan during the
decumulation phase. For a fixed annuitization time, to achieve higher final annuity, we consider a variable con\-
sumption rate. Moreover, to have a minimum guarantee for the final annuity, a safety level for the wealth process
is considered. To solve the stochastic optimal control problem via dynamic programming, we obtain a Hamilton\-
Jacobi\-Bellman (HJB) equation on a bounded domain. The existence and uniqueness of classical solutions are
proved through the dual transformation. We apply the finite difference method to find numerical approxima\-
tions of the solution of the HJB equation. Finally, the simulation results for the optimal investment\-consumption
56strategies, optimal wealth process and the final annuity for different admissible ranges of consumption are given.

Daher, M., Dahling, D., Pritchard, R., and Tseng, B. (2020\). From Accumulation to Decumulation – Why It Matters
and What Plan Sponsors Should Know . Tech. rep. Fidelity Investments.
Through conversations with Fidelity clients – and consistent with industry surveys – we have noted increasing
interest from DC plan sponsors in allowing retirees to stay in plan.
Retirees and pre\-retirees need help balancing risks – including investment, longevity, liquidity, and utilization
risk – to translate accumulated savings into sustainable income.
Fidelity’s recordkeeping data shows that older DC participants may not fully appreciate the importance of ap\-
propriate asset allocation and diversification as they age.
Sponsors wanting to allow participants to stay in plan should consider offering post\-retirement tools and edu\-
cation along with strategies and products that can help retirees to allocate their assets appropriately, generate
income, and safely draw down savings during retirement.
Dai, W. and Medhat, M. (2021\). “US Inflation and Global Asset Returns .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
We study the relation between US inflation and the performance of global asset classes (including bonds, stocks,
industry portfolios, factor premiums, commodities, and REITs), both over a long sample period (1927\-2020\)
and over the most recent 30 years (1991\-2020\). We find that most assets had positive average real returns in
both low\- and high\-inflation years. While average real returns were lower in years with higher inflation for
most assets, many of the differences are not statistically reliable, especially among non\-bond assets and in more
recent times. We also find mostly weak correlations over time between nominal returns and inflation, including
contemporaneous, lagged, expected, and unexpected inflation. The notable exceptions are energy stocks and
commodities, where there are reliably positive correlations with both expected and unexpected inflation, but
our results also suggest both assets are too volatile to be an effective inflation hedge. Our results confirm the
potential of most asset classes to outpace inflation over the long term and suggest that, for investors prioritizing
the preservation of purchasing power, inflation\-indexed securities may be a more appropriate inflation hedge
than commonly suggested alternatives.

variance optimal approach to wealth management .” In:Quantitative Finance 17(3\), pp. 335–351\.
In contrast to single\-period mean\-variance (MV) portfolio allocation, multi\-period MV optimal portfolio al\-
location can be modified slightly to be effectively a down\-side risk measure. With this in mind, we consider
multi\-period MV optimal portfolio allocation in the presence of periodic withdrawals. The investment portfolio
can be allocated between a risk\-free investment and a risky asset, the price of which is assumed to follow a jump
diffusion process. We consider two wealth management applications: optimal de\-accumulation rates for a defined
contribution pension plan and sustainable withdrawal rates for an endowment. Several numerical illustrations
are provided, with some interesting implications. In the pension de\-accumulation context, Bengen (1994\)?s \[J.
Financial Planning, 1994, 7, 171?180], historical analysis indicated that a retiree could safely withdraw 4 percent
of her initial retirement savings annually (in real terms), provided that her portfolio maintained an even balance
between diversified equities and U.S. Treasury bonds. Our analysis does support 4 percent as a sustainable
withdrawal rate in the pension de\-accumulation context (and a somewhat lower rate for an endowment), but
only if the investor follows an MV optimal portfolio allocation, not a fixed proportion strategy. Compared with
a constant proportion strategy, the MV optimal policy achieves the same expected wealth at the end of the
investment horizon, while significantly reducing the standard deviation of wealth and the probability of short\-
fall. We also explore the effects of suppressing jumps so as to have a pure diffusion process, but assuming a
correspondingly larger volatility for the latter process. Surprisingly, it turns out that the MV optimal strategy
is more effective when there are large downward jumps compared to having a high volatility diffusion process.
Finally, tests based on historical data demonstrate that the MV optimal policy is quite robust to uncertainty
about parameter estimates. In contrast to single\-period mean\-variance (MV) portfolio allocation, multi\-period
MV optimal portfolio allocation can be modified slightly to be effectively a down\-side risk measure. With this
in mind, we consider multi\-period MV optimal portfolio allocation in the presence of periodic withdrawals.
The investment portfolio can be allocated between a risk\-free investment and a risky asset, the price of which

The solution converges to that obtained from dynamic programming. Our approach is model\-free and generates
a solution that is based on forward simulation, whereas dynamic programming depends on backward recursion.

We report a dynamic programming algorithm which, given a set of efficient (or even inefficient) portfolios,

target wealth at the end of a designated time horizon. Our algorithm also accommodates periodic infusions or
withdrawals of cash with no degradation to the dynamic portfolio’s performance or runtime. We explore the
sensitivity of the terminal wealth distribution to restricting the segment of the efficient frontier available to the
investor. Since our algorithm’s optimal strategy can be on the efficient frontier and is driven by an investor’s
wealth and goals, it soundly beats the performance of target date funds in attaining investors’ goals. These
optimal goals\-based wealth management strategies are useful for independent financial advisors to implement
behavioral\-based FinTech offerings and for robo\-advisors.

We develop a dynamic programming methodology that seeks to maximize investor outcomes over multiple,
potentially competing goals (such as upgrading a home, paying college tuition, or maintaining an income stream
in retirement), even when financial resources are limited. Unlike Monte Carlo approaches currently in wide use
in the wealth management industry, our approach uses investor preferences to dynamically make the optimal
determinationforfulfillingornotfulfillingeachgoalandforselectingtheinvestor’sinvestmentportfolio.Thiscan
be computed quickly, even for numerous investor goals spread over different or concurrent time periods, where
each goal may be all\-or\-nothing or may allow for partial fulfillment. The probabilities of attaining each (full or
partial) goal under the optimal scenario are also computed, so the investor can ensure the algorithm accurately
reflects their preference for the relative importance of each of their goals. This approach vastly outperforms
static portfolio strategies and target\-date funds, widely used in the wealth management industry.

We consider an investor who is looking to maximize their probability of remaining solvent throughout their
lifetime by using an algorithm that aims to optimize their investment allocation strategy and optimize their tax
strategy for withdrawal allocations between tax deferred accounts (TDAs), Roth accounts, and taxable stock
and bond accounts. Our optimization works with stochastic investment returns and stochastic mortality. We find
that optimizing the investment strategy (via dynamic programming) has a much larger impact on the investor
remaining solvent than optimizing the tax strategy (via Monte Carlo and numerical optimization). This result
is key to effectively optimizing both strategies simultaneously. We show that our optimized investment strategy
soundly beats a standard target date fund strategy, while our novel optimized tax strategy displays the optimal
desired properties suggested by non\-stochastic tax optimization research.

Investment Strategies For Switching Between Bull and Bear Markets .” In:The Journal of Wealth Management
24(4\), pp. 8–36\.
We solve a dynamic, long\-horizon, goals\-based wealth management problem, given different investment regimes.
In a world with a good regime (bull market) and a bad regime (bear market), an investor who is cognizant
that regime switching occurs has the potential to do better than an investor who assumes only one regime.
However, models with more than one regime incur the additional risk of regime uncertainty. Investors must be

determines how accurate regime prediction needs to be to achieve gains from a regime\-cognizant goals\-based
investing approach.

Private Pension Schemes .” In:International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 18(5\) (2268\).
Long\-term care coverage is not integrated into an individual’s retirement strategy. It is an additional public
health service that is not considered into private pension funds. Nevertheless, this coverage is not sufficient due
totheproblemsoffinancialsustainabilityofthepublicpensionsystems.However,therearelargesumsinpension
plans dedicated to paying retirement pensions that can be transformed into support for long\-term care coverage.
This paper develops a mechanism of pension transformation through the different mortality of the beneficiary
when becoming a dependent beneficiary. This mechanism allows the beneficiary to convert their pension to LTC
support at their own choice, without increasing the cost of the private pension scheme. The proposed model
provides consistency in the pension that a retiree receives and adapts it to a retiree’s life expectancy: the retiree
receives a higher pension when he/she needs it most.

tions: An assessment from survey\-based and market\-based measures .” In:Journal of Forecasting 40(6\), pp. 1027–

The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we test the rationality of survey\-based and market\-based inflation
expectations. Secondly, we investigate whether they indicate a different performance of the central bank in
anchoring inflation expectations. Briefly, this paper verifies if inflation expectations’ proxies display the same
features regarding rationality and anchoring. Using data from the Brazilian market, we present robust evidence
that both survey\-based and market\-based inflation expectations have useful content to explain realized inflation.
Moreover, we find that these proxies of inflation expectations provide different assessments of the central bank’s
ability to anchor inflation expectations. The findings point out that central banks must monitor both survey\-
based and market\-based inflation expectations to improve their monetary policy conduct.

Lifestyle Level .” In:Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning 30(2\), pp. 277–288\.
An increasing number of individuals will be unable to retire comfortably amidst an international retirement
savings crisis. Research suggests that behavioral factors contribute to inadequate retirement savings. We present
a procedure that reframes the retirement savings decision, aimed at alleviating some of the negative effects of
the behavioral factors. This procedure shifts the focus from the required wealth at retirement (the future) to
the lifestyle an individual can afford to maintain now (the present). A sustainable lifestyle level (SLL) approach
is expressed mathematically and illustrated with practical examples. The SLL approach offers a practical tool
for retirement planning professionals to present recommendations that are simple and easy to understand for
individuals faced with complex retirement planning decisions.

In:Decisions in Economics and Finance 44(1\), pp. 161–175\.
The global reforms to public pension schemes over the last thirty years have progressively reduced individuals’
post\-retirement social security income. In order to compensate for this, individuals join pension funds and
individualplanstoincreasetheirwealthatretirement.Thesetypesoffullyfundedplansgenerallygiveindividuals
59the opportunity to withdraw the capital accumulated into their scheme or to convert it into an annuity. In this
paper, we analyse individuals’ post\-retirement choices to allocate the wealth at retirement between consumption,
risk\-free investments and a life annuity. We develop a discrete time optimisation model, in a deterministic
framework, with a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function. We study the effect of a bequest
motive and the annuity rate used by the insurer on the optimal choice. Several numerical applications are
presented to illustrate the optimal annuitisation decision results and the optimal consumption paths.
Dehm, C. (2020\). “Stochastic mortality : modelling and optimal investment .” PhD thesis. University of Ulm.
Nothing is more certain than death, nothing more uncertain than its hour. Even today the timepoint of death
is unknown, but death will occur with certainty. In this work, the uncertainty of death time is included in our
considerations of mortality modelling, optimal investment as insured under uncertain death time and optimal
investment as insurance company under mortality risk. This work provides three contributions to scientific
literature: In the first part, we suggest causality\-based modifications of the Gompertz law and the Lee Carter
model with focus on main death causes. In an application on German health data, we identify three main death
causes, namely ’diseases of circulatory system’, ’neoplasms’ and ’diseases of the respiratory system’, completed
bymodelling’accumulatedremainingdiseases’.UsingVAR(p)\-timeseriesmodels,weforecastlifeexpectancyand
life annuity for the total population as well as for the genders separately. The causal Lee Carter model for men
matches the holistic Lee Carter model best, with nearly same life expectancy and life annuity. Moreover, we find
that the predominant marginal impact on life expectancy are ’neoplasms’ with an average loss of about 5 years.
In the second contribution, we consider an optimal investment problem inspired by a life insurance contract.
These contracts usually have an option\-like form with the additional difficulty that the timepoint of benefit
payment (e.g. death of the insured) is uncertain. We generalize the known Merton problem in two directions: we
consider non\-concave optimization with uncertain investment maturity. In fact, we consider general non\-concave
utility functions and prove an existence and optimality result. To illustrate our findings, we do a numerical
study, which suggests that the occurrence of a possible premature stop leads to a reduced performance of the
optimal solution in terms of certainty equivalent. Due to the long term of an insurance contract, a typical life
insurance company is subject to interest and investment risks as well as mortality risk. In our third contribution,
we consider these risks as jump\-diffusion processes. Through (interest) zero\-coupon bond and longevity bond,
interest rate risk and mortality risk can be (partially) traded on the capital market. In this Levy\-market, we
derive an extended HJB equation system to be able to find closed\-form solutions of the optimal trading strategy
and the expected terminal value. We prove necessity and sufficiency of the HJB equation approach. Moreover,
we show a general L2\-asymptotic of truncated Levy processes.

The first decade of the 2000s saw two prolonged bear markets, both of which produced declines of over 50%
in value in the S\&P 500 Index from peak to trough. In total, the ten\-year period from March 1999 through
February 2009 saw the stock market lose more than 30 percent of its value. This period represented the worst
decade for the U.S. stock market since the Great Depression. For consumers who had the misfortune of retiring
in 1999, this ”lost decade” embodied the definition of sequence of returns risk. Researchers at the time could
only speculate as to the impact such sharply negative returns might have on the long\-term sustainability of
retiree spending portfolios.

Ageing and Social Security Research: Literature Review and Global Trends .” In:Mathematics 9(24\), p. 3258\.
Pension systems are one of the fundamental pillars of the welfare state. The ageing of the population caused by
longer life expectancy and low birth rates has led to a crisis in the public pension system in developed countries.
Changes for the system’s sustainability are necessary, and the scientific literature on the subject is abundant,
especially in recent years. This article aims to carry out a bibliometric analysis of the research carried out to
date, highlighting, in turn, future lines of research. The study was carried out on a total of 1287 articles published
from 1936 to 2021 and found in the Scopus database. The SciMAT, VOSviewer, and Datawrapper tools were
used to analyse the most important articles, authors, countries, and institutions by volume of production and
citations, as well as the relationships between them. Likewise, the most important keywords and their evolution
over time were highlighted,obtaining the main focus of the research. In addition to the general analysis, a specific
study was carried out in the area of Mathematics. The results show that the leading countries are the United
Kingdom, the USA, and the Netherlands. On the other hand, the lead subject area in which these articles have
60been published is Economics, Econometrics, and Finance. The research trends are sustainability, pension reform
related to ageing, and pension insurance.

Given its tax\-preferential treatment, careful study is warranted to determine whether life insurance can play
an important role in an overall retirement portfolio. This study develops hypothetical scenarios for different
types of individuals with varying ages and distribution periods, while using a historical outlook to determine
the proper structure of a variable universal life insurance policy. We compare a variable universal life policy
to different investment vehicles (both in qualified and non\-qualified accounts) on an after\-tax basis in order to
better understand the potential tradeoff for tax\-deferral and insurance fees within the life insurance.
Delong, L. and Chen, A. (2016\). “Asset allocation, sustainable withdrawal, longevity risk and non\-exponential
discounting .” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 71, pp. 342–352\.
The present paper studies an optimal withdrawal and investment problem for a retiree who is interested in
sustaining her retirement consumption above a pre\-specified minimum consumption level. Apparently, the with\-
drawal and investment policy depends substantially on the retiree’s health condition and her time preferences
(subjective discount factor). We assume that the health of the retiree can worsen or improve in an unpredictable
way over her lifetime and model the retiree’s mortality intensity by a stochastic process. In order to make
the decision about the consumption and investment policy more realistic, we assume that the retiree applies a
non\-exponential discount factor (an exponential discount factor with a small amount of hyperbolic discounting)
to value her future income. In other words, we consider an optimization problem by combining four impor\-
tant aspects: asset allocation, sustainable withdrawal, longevity risk and non\-exponential discounting. Due to
the non\-exponential discount factor, we have to solve a time\-inconsistent optimization problem. We derive a
non\-local HJB equation which characterizes the equilibrium optimal investment and consumption strategy. We
establish the first\-order expansions of the equilibrium value function and the equilibrium strategies by applying
expansion techniques. The expansion is performed on the parameter controlling the degree of discounting in the
hyperbolic discounting that is added to the exponential discount factors. The first\-order equilibrium investment
and consumption strategies can be calculated in a feasible way by solving PDEs.

or Portfolio Volatility Reduction? ” In:The Journal of Portfolio Management 42(2\), pp. 99–117\.
This article is concerned with the use of currently available technology to offer individuals, financial advisors,
and pension fund financial planners detailed prospective financial plans tailored to an individual’s financial
goals and obligations. By taking account of all an individual’s prospective cash flows, including servicing current
liabilities, and simultaneously optimizing prospective spending, saving, asset allocation, tax, and insurance,
etc. using dynamic stochastic optimization, the authors compare the results of their goal\-based fully dynamic
strategy with the financial advisory industry’s representative current best practices. These include piecemeal
fixed\-allocation portfolios for specific goals, target\-date retirement funds, and fixed real\-income post\-retirement
financial products, all using Markowitz mean\-variance optimization based on the very general goal of minimizing
portfolio volatility for a specific portfolio expected return over a finite horizon. Making use of the same data and
marketcalibrated Monte Carlo stochastic simulation for all the alternative portfolio strategies, the authors find
that flexibility is of key importance for both individual portfolio and spending decisions. The authors measure
superiority by the certainty\-equivalent increase in expected utility of individual lifetime consumption (gamma)
and the extra initial capital required by an individual to put the dominated strategy on the same expected\-
utility footing as the optimal dynamic strategy (initial capital gap). They find that the adaptive dynamic goal\-
based portfolio strategy’s performance is far superior to all the industry’s Markowitz\-based approaches. These
empirical results should put paid to the commonly held view that the extra complexity of holistic dynamic
stochastic models is not worth the marginal extra value obtained from their use.
Dempster, M. A. H. and Medova, E. A. (2011\). “Asset Liability Management for Individual Households .” In:British
Actuarial Journal 16(2\).
Personal finance is a challenging topic which can benefit from a scientific approach to individual financial
planning. This paper presents an individual asset liability management (iALM) model for life cycle planning
which uses the methodology of dynamic stochastic optimisation and incorporates ideas from both classical and
behavioural finance. Its implementation is in the form of a decision support tool for use by financial advisers or
wealth managers. The investment universe is given by a set of indices for major asset classes and their returns
are simulated forward over the lifetime of a household. On the liability side the foreseen cash flows of incomes
and outgoings are simulated and punctuated by life events such as illness and death. The household’s utility
61function is constructed for each time period over a range of monetary values in terms of household financial
goals and preferences. Taxes and pension savings are treated using the tax shielded saving accounts specific to
a national jurisdiction in terms of constraints in the optimisation sub\-models. The paper goes on to present
an analysis of iALM model recommendations for a representative UK household, together with an evaluation
of the sensitivity of the financial plan generated to changes in market environments such as the 2007\-9 crisis.
The promise of this new technology is to bring modern decision support tools to individual investors in order
to facilitate custom designed consumption, savings and investment policies.

Benefits.” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Using a lifecycle framework with Epstein\-Zin (1989\) utility and a mixed\-integer optimization approach, we
compute the optimal age to claim Social Security benefits. Taking advantage of homogeneity, a sufficient statistic
is the ratio of wealth to the primary insurance amount (PIA). If the investor’s wealth to PIA ratio exceeds a
certain threshold, individuals should defer Social Security for at least a year. The optimal threshold depends on
mortality assumptions and an individual’s utility preferences, but is less sensitive to capital market assumptions.
The threshold wealth to PIA ratio increases from 5\.5 for men and 5\.2 for women at age 62 to 11\.1 for men and
10\.4 for women at age 69\. Below the threshold wealth to PIA ratio, individuals claim Social Security to raise
consumption. Above this level, investors can afford to fund consumption out of wealth for at least one year, and
then claim a higher benefit.

Rate Is Stochastic .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
This paper studies the optimal life cycle consumption and portfolio choice problem taking into account annuity
risk due to stochastic interest rates. When the purchase of annuities is restricted to the retirement date, the
annuitant is exposed to the risk of meeting low interest rates at the purchase date. This annuity risk can be
diversified by spreading annuity purchases over the whole pre\-retirement period. The numerical results of our
life cycle model show that such temporal diversification enhances welfare for retirees up to 9% of certainty
equivalent consumption and that welfare gains increase with higher interest rate risk.

using a single\-period market timing strategy would have realized an almost identical performance. The value

and risk management .” In:International Review of Financial Analysis 68, p. 101429\.
Variable annuities (VAs) with various guarantees are popular retirement products in the past decades. However,
due to the sophistication of the embedded guarantees, most existing methods only focus on the one of embedded
guarantees underlying one specified stochastic model. The method to evaluate VAs with all guarantees and
manage its risk is very limited, except for the Monte Carlo method. In this paper, we propose an efficient
willow tree method to evaluate VAs embedded with all popular guarantees on the market underlying various
stochastic models. Moreover, our tree structure is also applicable to compute dollar delta, value at risk (VaR)
and conditional tail expectation (CTE) in hedging and risk\-based capital calculation. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method in pricing and managing the risk of VAs.

We investigate how well different investment strategies can give pre\-retirees more certainty about their income in
retirement, whilst allowing them to benefit from taking investment risk. Under an expected utility\-maximizing
framework, we find that a loss aversion utility function gives a high degree of certainty about its desired wealth
target and is robust to different market models. Imposing terminal wealth constraints does not improve the
certainty of achieving the desired target enough to counter\-balance the increased chance of obtaining a lower
income. The power utility function is not robust to different market models and becomes too risk\-averse with
wealth constraints.

Highly risk\-averse retirees are generally advised to adopt a fixed spending strategy such as the 4% withdrawal
rule. To prevent the premature depletion of a retirement portfolio, the rule attempts to proxy as the ”safe
withdrawalrate”.Butaconstantwithdrawalratemeansthatretireesaccumulateunspentsurpluseswhenmarkets
outperform and face spending shortfalls when markets underperform. While a safe withdrawal rate can prevent
spending shortfalls, the opportunity cost of unspent surpluses associated with this strategy can be extreme. We
apply a range of basic investment decision rules to a retirement portfolio applying various withdrawal rates and
examine the probability of shortfalls over a retirement horizon. Using a block bootstrap simulation technique,
we examine decision rules relating to stock and bond investments. Our results show that retirement portfolios
with a bias towards stocks coupled with a decision rule that sources withdrawals from bonds and cash before
stocks significantly outperforms alternative withdrawal strategies, despite the inherent increase in volatility.
This finding is in direct contrast to the safe withdrawal rate conventions used in contemporary financial advice
models.

In this article, the authors investigate the potential for real estate as an asset class to be exploited to protect
against sequencing risk (or path dependency) in defined contribution retirement funds. Their results suggest that
allocating both listed and unlisted real estate assets to retirement portfolios, even if very minor, can enhance the
risk\-return profile and probability of successfully achieving retirement outcomes. Using a bootstrap simulation
approach, the authors test for a range of asset allocations that include real estate. In addition, they examine
the sensitivity of real estate performance to changes in monetary policy to optimize portfolio outcomes for fund
managers who actively seek exposure to real estate assets. Their findings indicate that the performance of real
estate is highly dependent on monetary policy settings that, when used in a dynamic asset allocation process,
have the potential to enhance portfolio returns while limiting the impact of downside risk.

be mitigated through a dynamic life\-cycle strategy during the retirement phase.

64Portfolio ”glidepaths” accommodate growth in a worker’s early working life and transition to lower risk settings
as the worker nears retirement. The success of this design hinges on its objective of amassing wealth at the date
of retirement, but the design offers little in the way of a solution for the provision of income during retirement.
The relevant risk for workers is retirement income uncertainty. Allocating investments through time to satisfy an
income goal is not equivalent to the maximisation of wealth at retirement. We demonstrate that glidepaths can
be personalised for individuals to maximise expected retirement income sufficiency under a range of assumptions,
including longevity risk.
Dreyer, A. and Pogorelova, L. (2018\). “The Effect of Income\-Dependent Mortality on Withdrawal Strategies .” In:
The Journal of Retirement 6(1\), pp. 70–81\.
Recent literature documented significant dependency between individual lifetime earnings and life expectancy. In
light of this phenomenon, we examine the effect of using salary\-fitted mortality tables on optimized withdrawal
strategies. We find that although earnings rank meaningfully affects expected retirement length, the impact of
modeling salary\-fitted mortality is more nuanced and depends on the investor risk\-aversion parameter. In the
base case, a risk\-neutral investor is willing to adjust her optimal withdrawal strategy roughly in proportion to
the change in expected retirement length and can therefore experience a substantially larger misallocation of
withdrawals. In contrast, for a risk\-averse investor, a 10% income\-related difference in expected retirement length
does not necessitate a sizable adjustment of an optimized withdrawal strategy; the unconditional mortality
assumption causes annual withdrawal misallocation of only about 1% to 3% of pre\-retirement consumption.
Given this difference in results, we stress the need for a comprehensive and cohesive framework when analyzing
the full implications of a retirement horizon assumption.
Du, Y. (2021\). “Essays on Portfolio Choice and Health over the Life Cycle .” PhD thesis. Temple University.
This dissertation examines the effect of health and its associated variables on households’ consumption and
portfolio choices over life cycle. The first two essays constitute my job market paper, which explains why the
risky portfolio share rises in wealth from two health mechanisms: endogenous health investment and medical
expenditure risk. The third chapter explores the effect of health and health risk on households’ optimal con\-
sumption and portfolio decisions over life cycle.
Chapter 1 titled “PORTFOLIO CHOICE AND HEALTH ACROSS WEALTH: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE” il\-
lustrates the empirical relationship between the portfolio puzzle and the heterogeneity of health variables across
wealth. Classic financial theory suggests that under the assumption of no borrowing constraints and no mean\-
reverting stock returns, households should hold a constant risky portfolio in spite of their wealth, ages and life
horizons (Samuelson (1969\) and Merton (1969, 1971\)). Yet data from the Survey of Consumers Finances (SCF)
show that the risky portfolio share of financial assets increases in wealth. In the literature, this is called the
“portfolio puzzle”. Meanwhile, various sources of data indicate that, compared with the non\-wealthy households,
the wealthy people have better health, longer life horizon, higher out of pocket medical spending with lower
uncertainty, and more health care time. All these facts suggest a novel correlation between the portfolio puzzle
and the heterogeneity of health variables across wealth and provide a robust empirical foundation to explain the
portfolio puzzle from a health perspective.
In Chapter 2 titled “A LIFE CYCLE MODEL OF PORTFOLIO CHOICE AND HEALTH”, a life cycle model
with endogenous health investment and medical expenditure risk is proposed to capture the key empirical fea\-
tures in the first chapter. This calibrated model remarkably matches the U.S. data. I find that endogenous health
investment is essential to explain the portfolio puzzle: if health is exogenous without investment, the model can
only could deliver 7\.2% of the risky share gap across wealth. Medical expenditure risk is less important and has
a larger effect on the non\-wealthy group. If I abstract from medical expenditure risk, the risky shares increase
for both groups: 24% for the low wealth group and 5% for the wealthy group. This life cycle model provides new
insights into how health affects households’ financial behavior.
Chapter 3 titled “OPTIMAL CONSUMPTION AND PORTFOLIO CHOICE WITH HEALTH RISK” investi\-
gates the effect of health and health risk on households’ optimal consumption and portfolio allocations over the
life cycle. The simulation results show that consumption, savings in bonds, and savings in stocks all increase with
health. The risky portfolio share, which is the ratio of savings in stocks to the total financial assets, demonstrates
the same tendency for both health states over the life cycle: at the very young age, the risky portfolio share is
relatively high. Starting from the middle age, this share falls significantly and keeps steady until the end of life.
For most of the lifetime, the risky portfolio share is positively related with health. These results emphasize the
importance of health and its associated risk in consumption and portfolio decisions.

Women.” In:SSRN e\-Print .
This study estimates the expected benefit from delayed Social Security claiming for higher\-earning, healthier
women who can expect to receive more future income payments than other Americans. The expected net present
value of Social Security payments from delayed claiming for healthy women is $179,999, or more than twice the
value of delayed claiming for a male of average health. The benefit from delayed claiming ranges from a low
of $16,548 per year to $29,395 per year for healthy women. Even average health women gain at least $132,202
in Social Security wealth by waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security income benefits. Significant gains to
women who delay claiming are robust to a 2% increase in real discount rates and to a 21% reduction in income
that could occur if the Social Security trust fund depletes in 2026\. The added benefits from reduced longevity
and inflation risk suggest that the failure to delay claiming results in a significant loss in both retirement wealth
and expected welfare.
Dunham, L. M. and Washer, K. M. (2020\). “Using Life Tables for Retirement Planning .” In:The Journal of Wealth
Management 23(3\), pp. 28–36\.
This study examines two methods for determining retirement accumulations. The first method assumes that
the client will live to a very old age. This method may be appropriate for clients who are highly risk averse
and/or want to self\-insure the risk of outliving their savings. The second method employs life expectancy tables
to weight retirement cash flows by survival probabilities. The target accumulation under this method is much
lower and more easily attainable for clients than the first method. The primary drawback of the second method is
that, from a statistical point of view, about 55% of clients will outlive their savings. Because of this, risk\-sharing,
perhaps through a deferred life annuity, would be advisable unless clients have other viable options available
(e.g., family support) in the event that their savings are used up. We believe there is value in both methods and
that some clients will prefer a higher, more ambitious target, whereas others will prefer a lower, more attainable
target.

ering historical yields and inflation rates in Germany .” In:Zeitschrift fur die gesamte Versicherungswissenschaft
110, pp. 117–132\.
On account of the current low interest rate phase, which is most likely to continue in the coming years, the
average yields to be achieved in the bond, time deposit and savings product sectors are declining, so that risk\-
averse investors in particular have few opportunities to generate return\-oriented retirement provisions.
This scientific article analyzes the level of a possible safe withdrawal rate for diversified pension portfolios,
considering historical returns and inflation rates. Consequently, this article provides immediate practical added
value for a possible retirement provision.
The evaluation is based on the consideration of historical returns of the stock and bond market in Germany.
To determine a safe withdrawal rate, the development of portfolios with different compositions and inflation\-
adjusted withdrawal rates are simulated over periods of 15 to 35 years. In this simulation, the risky part of the
portfolio is represented by German equities, the low risk part by German government bonds.
To sum up, the empirical results show a maximum safe withdrawal rate of 4%. The underlying portfolio is
composed of 50% equities and 50% government bonds. Particularly due to the outlined demographic change in
Germany as well as the ongoing low\-interest phase, the empirical study can provide significant theoretical and
practical insights.

best way for most people to withdraw their savings. It’s called the ”spend safely in retirement strategy” (SSiRS)
and involves two basic components: delaying Social Security benefits and creating an ”automatic retirement

”Viability of the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy,” the research team took a deeper dive into the SSiRS

retirees, which the report defines as those having USD1 million or less in retirement savings. Here’s a closer look
at how the two key components of the SSiRS work.
Elnekave, R. (2007\). “The mathematics of savings and retirement planning .” In:The Journal of Wealth Management

66Saving and retirement planning currently rely on techniques that have proven to be failure prone at best, and
completely inadequate under the worst circumstances. Further, existing methods do not provide an understand\-
ing of the drivers behind the success or failure of savings plans. This lack of insight, combined with a deficient
framework, contributes to the adverse outcomes experienced by many pension plans and individuals. This arti\-
cle introduces a new perspective on modeling savings that borrows extensively from the field of hydrology. To
accomplish this, the author applies a modified version of mathematical techniques used by hydrologists in dam
building to savings and retirement planning. The goal is to present an intuitive decision framework, based on a
novel concept. In the process, the author hopes to open a new path in the dialogue to improve the state of the
art in savings and retirement planning.
Envestnet Research (2020\). Capital Sigma: The Advisor Advantage . Tech. rep. Envestnet.
We recently updated our quantitative research study, ”Capital Sigma: The Advisor Advantage,” which explores
how select sources of advisor\-created value can produce meaningful levels of excess return. For advisors to deliver
the most alpha to client portfolios, we recommend a focus on five sources: financial planning, asset selection and
allocation, investment selection, systematic rebalancing and tax management. The sum total of these five sources
creates what we call Capital Sigma. In fact, the combination of successfully implementing these five sources has
produced around 3% of value add annually –results that are consistent with PMC research first published in
2014\.

that realized portfolio returns generated from our long\-term strategies are considerably resilient to the episodes

In choosing when to start collecting Social Security, the differences in expected net present values (NPVs) are
small\-but the corresponding standard deviations are not. Starting earlier is less risky. The case analyzed is
single individuals in the U.S. system, but the methodology can be applied to couples and to the systems of other
nations. Considering risk and return together places Social Security in the same risk/return framework as other
capital investments. Behavioral, situational, and qualitative factors that often dominate decisions on when to
start are linked with quantitative approaches to longevity risk and mortality risk.

Target\-date funds have become a core product for investors who are saving for retirement. These funds pe\-
riodically reduce their allocations to stocks and increase their allocations to bonds and cash, becoming more
conservative as retirement approaches. This lifecycle strategy implies that investors are aggressive with little
capital and conservative with much more capital, which may be suboptimal in terms of wealth accumulation.
This article evaluates three alternative types of strategies, including contrarian strategies that follow a glidepath
opposite that of target\-date funds; that is, they become more aggressive as retirement approaches. The results
from a comprehensive sample that spans more than 19 countries, two regions, and 110 years suggest that, relative
to lifecycle strategies, the alternative strategies considered here provide investors with higher upside potential,
more limited downside potential, and higher uncertainty although that uncertainty is largely limited to how
much higher their terminal wealth is expected to grow with these strategies.

The failure rate is arguably the tool most widely used to evaluate retirement strategies. This tool has several
shortcomings, one of which is that it does not account for the very different bequests that different strategies
may leave behind. The maximum withdrawal rate is a novel tool that, besides dealing with this problem, is
useful for 1\) providing a comprehensive evaluation of retirement strategies, and 2\) evaluating the likelihood of
sustaining a target sequence of inflation adjusted withdrawals.
Estrada, J. (2017b). “Refining the Failure Rate .” In:The Journal of Retirement 4(3\), pp. 63–76\.
The importance of determining how often a retirement strategy failed in the past, and how likely it is to fail
in the future, can hardly be overstated. For this reason, the failure rate has become an essential tool when
evaluating these strategies. However, this variable is silent about how long into the retirement period a strategy
failed; two strategies that sustained withdrawals for 10 and 25 years of a 30\-year retirement period have both
failed, but a retiree would be far from indifferent between them. The two variables proposed here, which seek
to refine and complement, not to replace, the failure rate aim to correct this shortcoming.
Estrada, J. (2017c). “Replacing the Failure Rate: A Downside Risk Perspective .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
The evaluation of retirement strategies is typically based on the failure rate, although some alternatives have
been proposed recently, such as risk\-adjusted success (RAS), which aims to capture not just the failure but
also the success of the strategies evaluated. The main shortcoming of RAS is that it measures risk with the
standard deviation, which penalizes strategies that leave large bequests. The variable proposed here, downside
risk\-adjusted success (D\-RAS), addresses this shortcoming by taking a downside risk perspective, measuring risk
with the semideviation, and therefore with volatility below a chosen benchmark. This modification leads to the
selection of more plausible strategies than those selected by both the failure rate and RAS.
Estrada, J. (2018a). “From Failure to Success: Replacing the Failure Rate .” In:The Journal of Wealth Management
20(4\), pp. 9–21\.
The failure rate is arguably the variable most widely used in the evaluation of retirement strategies. Its main
shortcoming, evaluating how often a strategy fails but not by how much it does, is overcome by shortfall years,
which considers precisely this information. The joint use of the failure rate and shortfall years is an improvement
over using just the failure rate but implies the use of two variables, rather than just one, which do not always
point in the same direction. This article introduces a new variable, years sustained, that focuses on success
rather than on failure. The ratio between its mean and standard deviation, risk\-adjusted success, is the single
variable proposed here to be used in a comprehensive evaluation of retirement strategies.

Standard analysis of retirement strategies involves evaluating their failure rate. One of the shortcomings of
this approach is that a strategy may have a low failure rate and at the same time leave a large unintended
bequest. Maximum withdrawal rates, by definition, exhaust a portfolio by the end of the retirement period, thus
leaving no bequest; they can be used both to assess the likelihood of sustaining any chosen level of inflation\-

Planning for retirement, particularly during the accumulation period, largely consists of setting a target value for
the retirement portfolio and implementing a policy aimed at hitting that target. Financial plans are inevitably
based on expected returns, which are likely to be different from those an individual experiences during the
accumulation period. Thus, when the portfolio deviates from the path outlined in the plan, the individual can
choose between a static policy of sticking to his plan and simply hope to hit the target, or dynamic policies
designed to keep the portfolio close to its path. This article evaluates three types of such dynamic policies,
broadly referred to as to target (M2T), that adjust the periodic contributions or the portfolio asset allocation.
The results reported show that some of the dynamic policies outlined outperform a static policy, and adjusting
contributions is far superior to adjusting the asset allocation.
Estrada, J. (2020a). “Retirement Planning: From Z to A .” In:The Journal of Retirement 88(22\), pp. 8–22\.
68Retirement planning is an issue that must be tackled early and solved backward. It must be tackled early because
little can be done if an individual is not on the right path and has only a few years left to work. It must be
solved backward because it makes little sense to aim for a portfolio that may not be able to sustain the desired
lifestyle in retirement. This article introduces an approach that integrates the working period and the retirement
period; leads individuals to consider all relevant variables at the beginning of their journey; and enables them to
start saving early to build a target portfolio designed specifically to sustain a desired retirement. The analytical
framework introduced yields closed\-form solutions for the target retirement portfolio and the contributions that
need to be made during the working years to hit that target. The framework proposed is illustrated with an
empirical base case, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations.

Financial planners are keenly aware of, and routinely warn clients about, sequence risk; that is, the possibility
of facing a sequence of low returns early in retirement that may force retirees to scale down the plans they had
made. This really is a scary scenario, but one that the evidence here shows that retirees are not very likely to
encounter. A new and refined definition of sequence risk is advanced in this article, linking this type of risk to
the sustainability of a withdrawal strategy. Furthermore, three ways of assessing sequence risk are proposed,
among them one that enables a retiree to monitor the sustainability of his withdrawal strategy periodically
and to introduce adjustments when necessary. The ultimate message of this article is that retirees should be
informed, but not obsess, about sequence risk.

Target\-date funds feature asset allocations that become increasingly conservative as investors approach retire\-
ment. An important shortcoming of this strategy is that it is suboptimal in terms of capital accumulation, which
begs the question of why these funds are so popular. A possible answer is that investors become more risk averse
as they age, gradually favoring more downside protection as they approach retirement. The main issue explored
in this article is how much more risk averse would investors need to become during their working years to select
asset allocations similar to those in target\-date funds; the evidence here shows that investors would have to
roughly double their risk aversion during the last 25 years of their working period. An intuitive interpretation
of this result, based on how much an individual would pay to avoid a gamble, is also discussed.

Individual investors typically determine their asset allocation using investor questionnaires, which can be viewed

This article introduces an asset allocation tool, the gain\-pain index (GPI), that overcomes this shortcoming. The
tool proposed incorporates two critical variables found in investor questionnaires, the portfolio holding period
and the investor’s risk tolerance, and broadens the definition of risk beyond volatility by also considering the
69probability of suffering a loss and the magnitude of the loss. The model is used to determine optimal asset
allocations for 21 countries and the world market, for different holding periods and levels of risk aversion.
Estrada, J. (2021c). “The Sustainability of (Global) Withdrawal Strategies .” In:Journal of Financial Planning

The most important financial issue retirees have to deal with is whether their strategy will be able to sustain
all the withdrawals they expect to make and a bequest they aim to leave. It is critical to periodically monitor
the evolution of a financial plan in order to detect early signs of trouble, which may lead a retiree to introduce
dynamic adjustments to a strategy.
To that purpose, this article features two tools, a sustainability test and the sustainable withdrawal, and shows
how to apply them. This article also discusses the empirical evidence on both tools based on a comprehensive
sample of 22 markets over a 120\-year period.

Retirees need to make two critical financial decisions, namely, the withdrawal rate and the asset allocation of
their portfolios. We propose a methodology that retirees, and particularly advisors, could use to make these
decisions in an optimal way. We introduce a new variable, the coverage ratio, and a theoretical approach, based
on utility. Our approach can be used to make optimal decisions during both the accumulation and the retirement
period, but we illustrate it by focusing on the latter, and particularly on the choice of an optimal asset allocation.
We find that the strategies selected by our utility\-based approach are in general somewhat more aggressive than
those selected by the failure rate and other existing approaches.
Estrada, J. and Kritzman, M. (2019\). “Toward Determining the Optimal Investment Strategy for Retirement .” In:
The Journal of Retirement 7(1\), pp. 35–42\.
Investors who are about to retire are first and foremost concerned with supporting their spending needs through\-
out retirement. But they also derive satisfaction from growing their wealth beyond what is needed to support
consumption in order to leave a bequest to their heirs or chosen charities. The predominant metric for eval\-
uating retirement investment strategies is the failure rate. However, it doesn’t distinguish between strategies
that fail early in retirement from those that fail near the end of retirement, and it doesn’t account for potential
bequests. To overcome these shortcomings the authors propose a new metric, the coverage ratio, which is more
comprehensive and informative than the failure rate. In addition, they propose a utility function to evaluate the
coverage ratio, which penalizes shortfalls more than it rewards surpluses. Finally, the authors use their proposed
framework to determine the optimal allocation to stocks and bonds using historical and simulated returns.

Multiple Tests .” In:The Journal of Portfolio Management 45(1\), pp. 141–147\.
Selection bias under multiple testing is a serious problem. From a practitioner perspective, failure to disclose
the impact of multiple tests of a proposed investment strategy to clients and senior management can lead to
the adoption of a false discovery. Clients will lose money, senior management will misallocate resources, and
the firm may be exposed to reputational, legal, and regulatory risks. From the perspective of academic journals
that publish evidence supporting an investment strategy, the failure to address selection bias under multiple
testing threatens to invalidate large portions of the literature in empirical finance. In this article, the authors
propose a template that practitioners should use to fairly disclose multiple tests involved in an alleged discovery
when pitching strategies to clients and senior management. The same template could be used by contributors to
academic journals so that referees, and ultimately readers, can assess the strategy. By disclosing this information,
those who are charged with making the final decision about a discovery can evaluate the probability that the
purported discovery is false.

to fall short. We further generalize the estimation problem and techniques that allow robust inputs of mean and
covariance matrix estimators. Extensive numerical experiments lend further supports to our theoretical results.

Many retirees financial resources are insufficient to sustain their desired expenditures, which makes clear the

that directly incorporates spending targets within a multiperiod framework that improves performance with
respect to spending sustainability and bequest motives. We propose an model, which is dynamic and allows for
recourse decisions and permits changes in asset allocation in response to market outcomes as the retiree ages.
Practitioners can use the adaptive model to increase the sustainability of their clients spending and the funding
of bequests, thereby enhancing their clients welfare in their later years.

Fellowes, M., Fichtner, J. J., Plews, L., and Whitman, K. (2019\). The Retirement Solution Hiding in Plain Sight:
How Much Retirees Would Gain by Improving Social Security Decisions . Tech. rep. Capital One Investing.
Social Security now accounts for about one\-third of all income annually received by U.S. retirees, amounting
to $1 trillion in annual benefits. While impactful, research consistently finds that the financial effect of Social
Security could be even greater if more people waited to enroll, since monthly benefits can increase in value if
retirees delay claiming. But, we don’t know how much is annually lost from households making the sub\-optimal
decision about when to claim Social Security, how many are making mistakes, or who is making those wrong
decisions. To explore these questions, we utilize new technology invented by United Income and data sponsored
by the Social Security Administration, finding:
•Retirees will collectively lose $3\.4 trillion in potential income that they could spend during their retirement
because they claimed Social Security at a financially sub\-optimal time, or an average of $111,000 per
household. The average Social Security recipient would receive 9 percent more income in retirement if they
made the financially optimal decision about when to claim this retirement benefit.
•Current retirees will collectively lose an estimated $2\.1 trillion in wealth because they made the sub\-optimal
decision about when to claim Social Security, or an average of $68,000 per household. Most retirees will
lose wealth in their 60s and early 70s if they choose to optimize Social Security, but will be wealthier in
their late 70s through the rest of their lives.
•Only 4 percent of retirees make the financially optimal decision about when to claim Social Security. About
57 percent of retirees would build more wealth through their life if they waited to claim until they were 70
years old (when only 4 percent of retirees currently claim), while only 6\.5 percent of retirees would have
more wealth if they claimed prior to turning 64 (when over 70 percent of retirees currently claim benefits).
•About 21 percent of those at risk of not affording retirement (or having enough income to cover their
expected cost of living) would see an improvement in their chances if they claimed Social Security at the
optimal time. Among those retirees at risk that start with a greater than 10 percent chance of affording
retirement, 95 percent see their chances of affording retirement improve by an average of 28 percent.
•Elderly poverty could be cut by nearly 50 percent if all retirees claimed Social Security at the financially
optimal time. In particular, about 13 percent of people over the age of 70 are expected to live in poverty
at some point, which is estimated to fall to 7 percent if retirees had claimed Social Security at the optimal
time \-a rate that could potentially fall even further if they earned additional income while they waited to
claim Social Security.
This report finds that nearly no retirees are making the financially optimal decision about Social Security, and
that the costs of those mistakes are high for retiring households, particularly those at risk of not being able to
afford retirement. In addition, since making the optimal decision means sacrificing wealth in the near\-term, we
think it is unlikely more people will make the right decision without a policy intervention. There are numerous
difficulties associated with solving this problem, though, which will require a thorough and diverse process
for addressing. Among the topics for consideration should be the eligibility age range rules, which were last
materially modified in 1983\. Since 92 percent of retirees are expected to be better off waiting to claim until at
least their 65th birthday, claiming before should ideally be an exception for those who demonstrably need to
71claim benefits before the full retirement age. Means\-testing rules may be one way to address this, though an
easier place to start would be to change how the Social Security Administration frames claiming age options
to the public. Instead of portraying age 62 as the ”early eligibility age,” for instance, claiming at age 62 could
instead be labeled as the ”minimum benefit age” while age 70 could be labeled as the ”maximum benefit age.”
The Social Security Administration could also be provided with resources to improve utilization of the policy it
administers, perhaps in partnership with third\-party fiduciaries. With the potential to put $2\.1 trillion wealth
and $3\.4 trillion in income in the pockets of retirees, policymakers should be focused on improving this program.

benefits.” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 72, pp. 36–48\.
Variable annuity is a retirement planning product that allows policyholders to invest their premiums in equity
funds. In addition to the participation in equity investments, the majority of variable annuity products in today’s
market offer various types of investment guarantees, protecting policyholders from the downside risk of their
investments. One of the most popular investment guarantees is known as the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal
benefit (GLWB). In current market practice, the development of hedging portfolios for such a product relies
heavily on Monte Carlo simulations, as there were no known closed\-form formulas available in the existing
actuarial literature. In this paper, we show that such analytical solutions can in fact be determined for the
risk\-neutral valuation and delta\-hedging of the plain\-vanilla GLWB. As we demonstrate by numerical examples,
this approach drastically reduces run time as compared to Monte Carlo simulations. The paper also presents a
novel technique of fitting exponential sums to a mortality density function, which is numerically more efficient
and accurate than the existing methods in the literature.

Fidelity Research (2019\). Why work with a financial advisor . Tech. rep. Fidelity.
Industry studies estimate that professional financial advice can add between 1\.5% and 4% to portfolio returns
over the long term, depending on the time period and how returns are calculated. A one\-on\-one relationship
with an advisor is not just about money management. A financial advisor can help provide ongoing financial
planning so you can have peace of mind while pursuing your life goals. The financial planning process includes
defining your goals, understanding your current situation, and identifying the key steps to move forward. Beyond
long\-term goals like retirement, and shorter\-term ones like buying a house, education, or travel, holistic financial
planning can also include legacy planning, family support, health care, insurance, and charitable giving.

Finke, M. (2019\). Bill Sharpe Seeks a Better Retirement Income Solution . Tech. rep. ThinkAdvisor.
Sharpe still comes up with simple truths that can rock even a veteran’s understanding of retirement planning.
To Sharpe, the role of a financial advisor is to understand the range of options all clients face in order to build
an income that efficiently balances risk and return. The advisor needs to understand these tradeoffs, and he
or she needs to be able to explain them to a client. He’s even written a book that’s available on his Stanford
72website to help advisors ”focus more on communicating possible outcomes and helping the clients understand
the options.” Sharpe’s critique of the 4% rule is that the methodology is supposed to safely provide a straight
line of after\-inflation income using a portfolio of random returns over an unknown lifetime. But when you don’t
know what asset returns will look like and how long you’ll live, a retiree has two lifestyle choices: (1\) live well
and risk running out of money, or (2\) be conservative and risk giving too much to your heirs.
Finke, M. and Pfau, W. (2015\). “Reduce Retirement Costs with Deferred Income Annuities Purchased before
Retirement .” In:Journal of Financial Planning 28(7\), pp. 40–49\.
Most deferred income annuities (DIAs) have a relatively short deferral period, making them particularly ap\-
pealing to clients nearing retirement who value the ability to plan on a fixed, nominal income stream after
retirement. Unlike long\-term deferral period annuities (longevity insurance) that are primarily meant to protect
against longevity risk, a short\-term deferral period annuity can provide a steady income to pre\-fund retirement
spending over the entire retirement life cycle. The purchase of a DIA before retirement is particularly valuable for
clients who would have maintained a stock allocation lower than 70 percent. Retirees would have been better off
without a DIA in simulations where portfolio returns are very high or when retirees die early. Findings suggest
that short deferral period annuities can reduce the cost of funding retirement, provide longevity protection, and
offer behavioral benefits to clients concerned about near\-retirement market performance.

Consulting 17(1\), pp. 22–30\.
This paper provides an introduction to strategies that can be used to turn a retirement portfolio into income.
Defined contribution savings present a retirement planning challenge when asset returns, longevity, and spending
needs are uncertain. We present the fundamental trade\-offs of managing an investment portfolio and decumulat\-
ing investments in retirement, and we discuss the potential benefit of financial products that address portfolio
and spending risks. Simulations illustrate the trade\-offs among legacy, liquidity, and shortfall risk. We dis\-cuss
a comprehensive strategy that combines longevity protection, portfolio allocation, and dynamic spending based
on realized portfolio returns to provide a guideline for professionals building retirement income plans for clients.
We then provide an overview of the benefits of adding products such as annuities to a traditional investment
portfolio to reduce longevity risk and increase expected spending. The primary purpose of this paper is to
provide a fundamental overview of current research and theory on retirement income planning.

Funds.” In:The Journal of Retirement 5(4\), pp. 40–45\.
Investingisacomplicatedaffair,particularlyforpeoplewithlowfinancialliteracy.Target\-datefundsaredesigned
to make investing easy for pension participants. To simplify the employee decision, many defined contribution
plans offer employees a target\-date fund based on only one piece of data employee expected retirement date.
The employee may be placed in a target\-date fund as the default plan if the employee does not make an active
choice. Target\-date funds one\-size\-fits\-all approach generally does not provide the appropriate level of risk for all
employees who plan to retire in a given year. The authors address that issue in this article. Their proposal has
three parts. First, they propose that target\-date funds should allow greater personalization of investments by
offering participants a conservative, moderate, and risky fund for each target\-date. While pension participants
currently have the option of choosing a more or less risky target\-date fund by choosing a later or earlier target\-
date than their actual retirement date, many pension participants lack the sophistication to take advantage of
that option. Second, they suggest that pension plans incorporate robo advisers to help participants identify the
appropriate level of risk and appropriate target\-date fund based on their personal circumstances. Third, they
propose on\-the\-spot financial education, to be provided when a participant is selecting a target\-date fund, to
help participants understand the implications of risk level and target\-date fund choice for both pension growth
and the range of possible outcomes.

We estimate a stochastic life\-cycle model of endogenous health spending, asset accumulation, and retirement
to investigate the causes behind the increase in health spending and longevity in the United States over the
period 1965\-2005\. Accounting for changes over time in taxes, transfers, Social Security, income, health insurance,
smoking and obesity, and technological progress, we estimate that technological progress is responsible for half
of the increase in life expectancy over the period. Substantial growth in health spending over the period is
largely the result of growth in economic resources and the generosity of health insurance, with a modest role
for medical technological progress. The growth in spending does not come from changes in a single source, but
73sources jointly interacted to increase spending: complementarity effects explain up to 26\.3% of the increase in
health spending. Overall, for those born in 1940, the combined changes in resources and health insurance that
occurred over the period are valued at 35\.7% of lifetime consumption.
Forsyth, P. (2021\). “Two stage decumulation strategies for DC plan investors .” In:International Journal of Theo\-
retical and Applied Finance 24(01\) (2150007\).
Optimal stochastic control methods are used to examine decumulation strategies for a defined contribution (DC)
plan retiree. An initial investment horizon of 15 years is considered, since the retiree will attain this age with
high probability. The objective function reward measure is the expected sum of the withdrawals. The objective
function tail risk measure is the expected linear shortfall with respect to a desired lower bound for wealth at 15
years. The lower bound wealth level is the amount which is required to fund a lifelong annuity 15 years after
retirement, which generates the required minimum cash flows. This ameliorates longevity risk. The controls
are the withdrawal amount each year, and the asset allocation strategy. Maximum and minimum withdrawal
amounts are specified. Specifying a short initial decumulation horizon, results in the optimal strategy achieving:
(i) median withdrawals at the maximum rate within 2\-3 years of retirement (ii) terminal wealth larger than
the desired lower bound at 15 years, with greater than 90% probability and (iii) median terminal wealth at 15
years considerably larger than the desired lower bound. The controls are computed using a parametric model
of historical stock and bond returns, and then tested in bootstrap resampled simulations using historical data.
At the 15 year investment horizon, the retiree has the option of (i) continuing to self\-manage the decumulation
policy or (ii) purchasing an annuity.
Forsyth, P., Vetzal, K. R., and Westmacott, G. (2017a). “Target Wealth: The Evolution of Target Date Funds .” In:
SSRN e\-Print .
Target Date Funds have become very popular with investors saving for retirement. The main feature of these
funds is that investors are automatically switched from high risk to low risk assets as retirement approaches.
However, our analysis brings into question the rationale behind these funds. Based on a model with parameters
fittedtohistoricalreturns,andalsoonmodelindependentbootstrapresampling,wefindthatconstantproportion
strategies give virtually the same results for terminal wealth at the retirement date as target date strategies.
This suggests that the vast majority of Target Date Funds are serving investors poorly. However, if we allow
the asset allocation strategy to adapt to the current level of the total portfolio value, significantly lower risk of
terminal wealth can be achieved, at no cost to its expected value.
Forsyth, P., Vetzal, K. R., and Westmacott, G. (2018\). “Management of Withdrawal Risk Through Optimal Life
Cycle Asset Allocation .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Retirees who do not have defined benefit pension plans typically must fund spending from accumulated savings.
This leads to the risk of depleting these savings, i.e. withdrawal risk. We analyze this risk through full life
cycle optimal dynamic asset allocation, including the accumulation and decumulation phases. We pose the asset
allocation strategy as a problem in optimal stochastic control. Various possible objective functions are tested
and compared using metrics such as the probability of portfolio depletion, the median of the remaining portfolio
value, and conditional value at risk (CVAR). The control problem is solved using a Hamilton\-Jacobi\-Bellman
formulation, based on a parametric model of the underlying stochastic processes and a variety of objective
functions. Monte Carlo simulations which use the optimal controls are presented to evaluate the performance
metrics. These simulations are based on both the parametric model and bootstrap resampling of 91 years of
historical data. Based primarily on the resampling tests, we conclude that target\-based approaches which seek
to establish a safety buffer of wealth at the end of the decumulation period appear to be superior to strategies
which directly attempt to minimize risk measures such as the probability of portfolio depletion.

Weposethedecumulationstrategyforadefinedcontribution(DC)pensionplanasaprobleminoptimalstochas\-
tic control. The controls are the withdrawal amounts and the asset allocation strategy. We impose maximum
and minimum constraints on the withdrawal amounts, and impose no\-shorting no\-leverage constraints on the
asset allocation strategy. Our objective function measures reward as the expected total withdrawals over the
decumulation horizon, and risk is measured by expected shortfall (ES) at the end of the decumulation period. We
solve the stochastic control problem numerically, based on a parametric model of market stochastic processes.
We find that, compared to a fixed constant withdrawal strategy, with minimum withdrawal set to the constant
withdrawal amount the optimal strategy has a significantly higher expected average withdrawal, at the cost
74of a very small increase in ES risk. Tests on bootstrapped resampled historical market data indicate that this
strategy is robust to parametric model misspecification.
Forsyth, P. A. (2022b). “Short term decumulation strategies for underspending retirees .” In:Insurance: Mathematics
and Economics 102, pp. 56–74\.
There is growing empirical evidence that many retirees are decumulating their assets very slowly, if at all. This
fact is in stark contrast to the usual lifecycle models of spending. It appears that these underspending retirees
adjust their withdrawals to avoid reducing their assets. In order to appeal to this class of retirees, we use optimal
stochastic control techniques which maximize a multi\-objective risk\-reward problem. The reward is the total of
withdrawals (over a five year period), while risk is based on a left tail measure. Our controls for this problem are
the withdrawal amount per quarter, and the stock\-bond asset allocation. We allow flexible withdrawals (even
zero). This added flexibility results in a high probability of (i) retaining 90% of real wealth at the end of five
years, and (ii) significant total spending over the five years. We suggest that these types of strategies will be
appealing this underspending group of retirees.
Forsyth, P. A., Li, Y., and Vetzal, K. R. (2017b). “Are target date funds dinosaurs? Failure to adapt can lead to
extinction .” In:arXiv e\-Print .
Investors in Target Date Funds are automatically switched from high risk to low risk assets as their retirements
approach. Such funds have become very popular, but our analysis brings into question the rationale for them.
Based on both a model with parameters fitted to historical returns and on bootstrap resampling, we find that
adaptive investment strategies significantly outperform typical Target Date Fund strategies. This suggests that
the vast majority of Target Date Funds are serving investors poorly.
Forsyth, P. A. and Vetzal, K. R. (2019\). “Optimal asset allocation for retirement saving: deterministic vs. time
consistent adaptive strategies .” In:Applied Mathematical Finance 26(1\), pp. 1–37\.
We consider optimal asset allocation for an investor saving for retirement. The portfolio contains a bond index
and a stock index. We use multi\-period criteria and explore two types of strategies: deterministic strategies are
based only on the time remaining until the anticipated retirement date, while adaptive strategies also consider
the investor accumulated wealth. The vast majority of financial products designed for retirement saving use
deterministic strategies (e.g., target date funds). In the deterministic case, we determine an optimal open loop
control using mean\-variance criteria. In the adaptive case, we use time consistent mean\-variance and quadratic
shortfall objectives. Tests based on both a synthetic market where the stock index is modelled by a jump\-
diffusion process and also on bootstrap resampling of long\-term historical data show that the optimal adaptive
strategies significantly outperform the optimal deterministic strategy. This suggests that investors are not being
well served by the strategies currently dominating the marketplace.

Life Cycle Asset Allocation .” In:North American Actuarial Journal 23(3\), pp. 447–468\.
Members of defined contribution (DC) pension plans must take on additional responsibilities for their invest\-
ments, compared to participants in defined benefit (DB) pension plans. The transition from DB to DC plans
means that more employees are faced with these responsibilities. We explore the extent to which DC plan mem\-
bers can follow financial strategies that have a high chance of resulting in a retirement scenario that is fairly close
to that provided by DB plans. Retirees in DC plans typically must fund spending from accumulated savings.
This leads to the risk of depleting these savings, that is, portfolio depletion risk. We analyze the management
of this risk through life cycle optimal dynamic asset allocation, including the accumulation and decumulation
phases. We pose the asset allocation strategy as an optimal stochastic control problem. Several objective func\-
tions are tested and compared. We focus on the risk of portfolio depletion at the terminal date, using such
measures as conditional value at risk (CVAR) and probability of ruin. A secondary consideration is the median
terminal portfolio value. The control problem is solved using a Hamilton\-Jacobi\-Bellman formulation, based on
a parametric model of the financial market. Monte Carlo simulations that use the optimal controls are presented
to evaluate the performance metrics. These simulations are based on both the parametric model and bootstrap
resampling of 91 years of historical data. The resampling tests suggest that target\-based approaches that seek
to establish a safety margin of wealth at the end of the decumulation period appear to be superior to strategies
that directly attempt to minimize risk measures such as the probability of portfolio depletion or CVAR. The
target\-based approaches result in a reasonably close approximation to the retirement spending available in a
DB plan. There is a small risk of depleting the retiree funds, but there is also a good chance of accumulating a
buffer that can be used to manage unplanned longevity risk or left as a bequest.

We extend the Annually Recalculated Virtual Annuity (ARVA) spending rule for retirement savings decumu\-
lation (Waring and Siegel (2015\) Financial Analysts Journal, 71(1\), 91\-107\) to include a cap and a floor on
withdrawals. With a minimum withdrawal constraint, the ARVA strategy runs the risk of depleting the invest\-
ment portfolio. We determine the dynamic asset allocation strategy which maximizes a weighted combination
of expected total withdrawals (EW) and expected shortfall (ES), defined as the average of the worst 5% of the
outcomes of real terminal wealth. We compare the performance of our dynamic strategy to simpler alternatives
which maintain constant asset allocation weights over time accompanied by either our same modified ARVA
spending rule or withdrawals that are constant over time in real terms. Tests are carried out using both a
parametric model of historical asset returns as well as bootstrap resampling of historical data. Consistent with
previous literature that has used different measures of reward and risk than EW and ES, we find that allowing
some variability in withdrawals leads to large improvements in efficiency. However, unlike the prior literature,
we also demonstrate that further significant enhancements are possible through incorporating a dynamic asset
allocation strategy rather than simply keeping asset allocation weights constant throughout retirement.

Although financial advisors and institutions are increasingly urged to adopt objectives or goals\-based investment
strategies, there is a need to more clearly define what is meant by investment objectives and their effects on out\-
comes. In a controlled modeling experiment, I formalize two investor personas (Accumulator and Decumulator)
and two investment strategies (Target Cash Flows and Target Wealth) to provide a deeper understanding of
the effects on investor ”success” or ”failure.” In addition, applying characteristics that are potentially available
in actively managed funds, such as differences among investments in terms of beta, alpha, and sequence of re\-
turns, enables the demonstration of several surprising effects, including changes in the distribution of investment
returns and, of importance, the trajectory of investor outcomes in an objectives\-based framework.

This paper explored a method that combined actuarial approaches for calculating withdrawals in retirement
with Monte Carlo simulations. The model recalculated withdrawals for each scenario within each simulation,
with a new simulation beginning for each year based on individual capital remaining and adjusted time horizons
using mortality tables. The model approach made a direct connection between the various elements making up
spending decisions. There were important differences between a simulation that used decision rules to shape
income and altered initial withdrawal assumptions, and a model that recast each subsequent year in isolation.
The combination of stochastic simulations and period\-adjusting actuarial withdrawal techniques proposed here
has been termed Continually Adjusting Stochastic Actuarial Model (CASAM).

The authors develop an age\-based, three\-dimensional distribution model that illustrates a retiree’s yearly tran\-
sition through retirement, including superannuated years (very old age), to demonstrate the impact of longevity
risk
The model builds on ”Probability\-of\-Failure\-Based Decision Rules to Manage Sequence Risk in Retirement” by
Frank, Mitchell, and Blanchett (2011\) to simultaneously:
1\)Establish an age\-based distribution model
762\)Incorporate current\-age life expectancy
3\)Address survivorship into superannuated ages
4\)Address market sequence risk
5\)Develop a method to rationally incorporate retiree goals of either consumption or inheritance, and switch
between the two as desired
Past research has primarily focused on fixed, non\-age\-specific distribution periods. The model developed in this
paper demonstrates:
•How longevity probability can be developed into dynamic, yearly adjustable distribution periods
•These dynamic distribution periods can then be combined with stochastic (Monte Carlo) real returns
•The distribution period (DP) can be dynamically managed, as the retiree ages, by varying the percentiles
of longevity
•The withdrawal rate is very sensitive to DP, and the DP is very sensitive to life expectancy; thus more
attention should be paid to longevity risk than has been in past research
•The probability of failure (POF) remains a useful metric to evaluate exposure of a retiree’s portfolio to
market sequence risk, and a POF\-based decision rule applies to both the asset allocation effect and the age
effect on withdrawal rates

empirical evidence from Switzerland .” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 81, pp. 51–70\.
Abstract Due to the demographic changes and population aging occurring in many countries, the financing of
long\-term care (LTC) poses a systemic threat. The scarcity of knowledge about the probability of an elderly
person needing help with activities of daily living has hindered the development of insurance solutions that
complement existing social systems. In this paper, we consider two models: a frailty level model that studies the
evolution of a dependent person through mild, moderate and severe dependency states to death and a type of
care model that distinguishes between care received at home and care received in an institution. We develop and
interpret the expressions for the state\- and time\-dependent transition probabilities in a semi\-Markov framework.
Then, we empirically assess these probabilities using a novel longitudinal dataset covering all LTC needs in
Switzerland over a 20\-year period. As a key result, we are the first to derive dependence probability tables by
acuity level, gender and age for the Swiss population. We find that the transition probabilities differ significantly
by gender, age and time spent in the frailty level and type of care states.
Fullmer, R. K. (2009\). “A Framework for Portfolio Decumulation .” In:Journal of Investment Consulting 10(1\),
pp. 63–71\.
Before the bear market of 2008\-09, the conventional wisdom was that conservative asset allocations might
not provide sufficient returns for the long horizons that many retirees face. Therefore, new retirees needed
significant allocations to equity. The advice often came with a call to invest more aggressively in the early years
of retirement, then taper the equity exposure later in retirement. Arguments for this approach typically present
results of Monte Carlo simulation showing that higher equity allocations, particularly early in retirement, can
increase the probability of sustaining higher withdrawal rates from the portfolio. But these arguments fall victim
to at least two fallacies.
The first fallacy is tragically ironic. Even though the advice is based on probability theory, it overlooks a primary
tenet emphasized by Blaise Pascal, the founder of probability theory. Pascal realized that while probability
matters, so do consequences. In fact, Pascal emphatically warned against playing the odds without considering
the consequences. While it may be true that higher equity exposures can increase the likelihood of sustaining
higher withdrawal rates, they also increase the magnitude of failure in unsuccessful cases. Students of investment
theory may recognize this oversight as a form of ”the fallacy of time\-diversification of risk.” By making the
portfolio more aggressive, the risk of achieving poor returns puts the entire financial plan in peril. The retiree
may go broke early, face a lower standard of living, or abandon retirement altogether. So everyone who advises
retirees must seriously ponder the following question: Even though higher equity allocations may raise the
probability of success for a retirement income plan, does this necessarily mean that higher equity allocations are
less risky?
The second fallacy involves an assumption underlying most simulation methodologies. The assumption is that
the investment strategy is predetermined at the start of the investment horizon. Examples of predetermined
strategies include allocations that remain static over the entire horizon or that use glide paths similar to that
of target date funds, in which the equity exposure tapers over time. The only way such an assumption makes
sense, however, is if the investor’s risk exposure is static over time. But for retirees who depend on nest eggs
for living expenses, this assumption is never correct. Holding more\-aggressive portfolios early in retirement and
less\-aggressive allocations later in retirement leads to the retiree taking the most investment risk precisely when
it is most risky to do so \- when the risk of outliving the portfolio (longevity risk) is greatest.

This chapter presents Richard K. Fullmer’s paper, titled ”Modern Portfolio Decumulation.” It is a logical ex\-
tension of his mis\-measurement of risk work. It describes a new framework for efficient portfolio construction
in the decumulation phase of the investment lifecycle, in which an investor who has accumulated assets over
78time wishes to use those assets to fund ongoing living expenses. It combines elements of both investment theory
and actuarial science, introducing an effective way to manage longevity risk in the portfolio. The chapter dis\-
cusses that the conventional standard for accumulation of wealth is not optimal for decumulation. It outlines
an alternative approach for investing in the decumulation phase, bringing focus upon dynamic asset allocation
models.

Plans.” In:The Journal of Retirement 1(4\), pp. 75–94\.
In this article, the authors present a methodology to support sponsors of defined\-contribution (DC) plans when
evaluating the allocation to equity over a target\-date fund’s glide path. When evaluating glide paths, sponsors
must pay heed to two primary goals: The first is to generate lifetime income consistently over the course of
retirement; the second is to limit the risk of capital loss near and during retirement, which is particularly
important for participants who withdraw balances over short horizons. The challenge of glide path selection
is striking a compromise between these competing goals. This compromise cannot be achieved via objective
analysis alone and must also be informed by the subjective horizon and risk preferences of the sponsor acting as
agent for the plan participants. The authors find that higher\-equity glide paths offer greater efficacy for lifetime
income replacement, while lower\-equity glide paths offer greater efficacy for stable account balances with lower
risk of capital losses. These conclusions hold over a wide range of plan characteristics and assumptions, although
the relative magnitude of the trade\-off depends on characteristics unique to each plan.

We analyze real\-time forecasts of US inflation over 1999Q3\-2019Q4 and subsamples, investigating whether and

While simple models remain hard to beat, additional information does improve forecasts, especially after 2009\.
Notably, forecast combination improves forecast accuracy over simpler models and robustifies against bad fore\-
casts; aggregating forecasts of inflation’s components can improve performance compared to forecasting the
aggregate directly; and judgmental forecasts, which may incorporate larger and more timely datasets in con\-
junction with model\-based forecasts, improve forecasts at short horizons.

We study optimal life\-cycle portfolio allocation and its application to target\-date fund (TDF) design. We show
that optimal TDF allocation must be explicitly linked to a savings rate; for example, a higher savings rate
generating higher financial wealth accumulation should necessarily come with a more conservative TDF. Further,
we quantify the extent to which accumulated wealth, the investing environment, and participant characteristics
affect TDF allocations and compare the resulting optimal allocations against the observed universe of US TDF
products. Plan sponsors and asset managers can use these findings to improve TDF selection and design.

intuitive, practical metrics. Anchored in the complex theory of life\-cycle investing, we propose a comprehensive
collection, or , of measures to capture various aspects of the problem: wealth\-focused versions of return and risk
concepts; the link between retirement contributions and portfolio returns; the strategy ability to support income
in retirement; and behavior around retirement, a period when risk to invested wealth is greatest. These metrics
are synthesized into one holistic view based on investor\-specific preferences, highlighting the connection between
investor characteristics and the life\-cycle investment problem.
Gan, G. (2013\). “Application of data clustering and machine learning in variable annuity valuation .” In:Insurance:
Mathematics and Economics 53(3\), pp. 795–801\.
We study the pricing of a large portfolio of VA policies. A clustering method is used to select representative
policies. A machine learning method is used to estimate the guarantee value. The proposed method performs
well in terms of accuracy and speed. The valuation of variable annuity guarantees has been studied extensively
in the past four decades. However, almost all the studies focus on the valuation of guarantees embedded in a
single variable annuity contract. How to efficiently price the guarantees for a large portfolio of variable annuity
contracts has not received enough attention. This paper fills the gap by introducing a novel method based on
79data clustering and machine learning to price the guarantees for a large portfolio of variable annuity contracts.
Our test results show that this method performs very well in terms of accuracy and speed.
Gao, X. and Sun, L. (2021\). “Modeling retirees’ investment behaviors in the presence of health expenditure risk
and financial crisis risk .” In:Economic Modelling 94, pp. 442–454\.
This paper examines the impact of both health risks and financial market turmoil on individual investment
decisions during retirement. Using a panel data set compiled from the U.S. Health and Retirement Survey,
we find that health shocks increase retirees’ disposable income uncertainty and compromise their risk\-taking
capacity. This is especially the case for those with moderate levels of wealth. However, we find that health risk
alone cannot explain the empirically observed lower level of risky asset investment behaviors. It is the presence
of extreme events in the financial markets, in combination with health risks, that significantly reduce retirees’
incentives to invest in risky assets. Compared with younger investors, retirees’ shorter investment horizon and
higher health risks render them more vulnerable to the detrimental consequences of wealth evaporation caused
by financial crises. Our results indicate that effective portfolio management for retirees must take into account
both their health risks and the occurrence of financial market tail risks.
Gard, R. and Gremm, M. (2018\). “Two Measures of Financial Risk Tolerance from Questionnaire Data .” In:SSRN
e\-Print.
Set\-based principal component analysis extracts two independent measures of financial risk tolerance from
questionnaire responses. These measures are less noisy than most scoring methods. They are also more robust
because they provide a redundant assessment of financial risk tolerance. This analysis reveals that typical
risk questionnaires measure financial risk tolerance and income\-related risk tolerance. These two factors are
unrelated, which suggests that income\-related questions should be dropped from financial risk questionnaires.
We also examine how financial risk tolerance depends on financial literacy and gender.
Ge, W. (2019a). “Optimal Glide Path Selection for Low\-Volatility Assets .” In:The Journal of Index Investing 10(3\),
pp. 70–84\.
Target\-date funds (TDFs) have become a popular choice for retirement plans, and the concept of a glide path is
essential for TDFs. One of the key assumption behind glide paths is that the main component of a retirement
plan should be growth assets invested in the overall equity market example, the S\&P 500 Index. Researchers have
recently challenged this assumption and argued for using smart beta factors for retirement purposes. Among
them, the factor of low volatility may be uniquely suitable for retirement investing. This article studies the use
of low\-volatility assets for the purpose of retirement planning and the choice of ideal glide paths. This study
is agnostic about the means by which the low\-volatility risk/return profile is achieved and analyzes four series
with diminished volatility constructed with different methodologies. The article concludes that low\-volatility
assets may indeed help retirement investors achieve their objectives, though such investors must choose ideal
glide paths carefully to suit the selected low\-volatility series. When equipped with proper low\-volatility assets
and carefully chosen glide paths, retirement plan managers may both improve the odds that their plans succeed
and increase the expected final wealth levels.
Ge, W. (2019b). “Utilizing Low\-Volatility Assets To Mitigate Sequence Risk In Retirement Investing .” In:The
Journal of Investing 28(5\), pp. 85–100\.
Sequence risk is a subtle risk factor retirement investment managers face that can hinder their plans for success.
This article illustrates the damaging effects that sequence risk can have on retirement plans and how asset
volatility can exacerbate this risk. The study analyzes an asset\-centric approach that utilizes low\-volatility
assets to mitigate sequence risk, as their diminished volatility implies more certainty for retirement plans. It
further examines the return\-risk profiles of four candidate low\-volatilityseries, compares their performance either
as stand\-alone series or in the context of 60/40 portfolios with the traditional equity represented by the S\&P 500
Index, and finally employs two sets of Monte Carlo simulations to assess the effectiveness of such assets for the
task of sequence risk mitigation. The study demonstrates that 60/40 portfolios with low\-volatility components
can significantly reduce the uncertainty of retirement investment outcomes in terms of both narrower final wealth
ranges and reduced failure rates.

In:Journal of Financial Planning 34(3\), pp. 72–89\.
This article examines several decumulation strategies for a client approaching retirement with a mix of tax\-
favored retirement accounts and taxable accounts, each holding appreciated stocks and taxable bonds.
The analysis applies these strategies to three ”nest egg” scenarios to determine their resulting portfolio lives,
while examining tax consequences throughout those lives.
80In these scenarios, the more tax\-efficient decumulation strategies last from 1 to over 11 percent longer than both
the Conventional Wisdom and Schwab’s recently marketed decumulation strategies.
The results provide insights that financial planning professionals can use to tailor tax\-efficient decumulation
recommendations that better fit a client’s particular situation, increasing how long their wealth lasts during
retirement.

Up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits could be taxable, with the percentage increasing as income increases.
Additional income can cause additional Social Security benefits to be taxable, a so\-called ”tax torpedo.” The tax
effect of this tax torpedo depends on the tax bracket in which the benefits are taxed. This effect can be as high
as 21\.25 percent of the additional income, but it is less than 10 percent in many circumstances. This tax effect
is an important factor to consider when deciding whether to start Social Security benefits at age 62 or age 70\.

longevity risk .” In:Annals of Actuarial Science 14(2\), pp. 302–315\.
We derive optimal portfolio choice patterns in retirement (ages 66\-105\) for a constant relative risk aversion
utility maximising investor facing risky capital market returns, stochastic mortality risk, and income\-reducing
health shocks. Beyond the usual stocks and bonds, the individual can invest his assets in tontines. Tontines are
cost\-efficient financial contracts providing age\-increasing, but volatile cash flows, generated through the pooling
of mortality without guarantees, which can help to match increasing financing needs at old ages. We find that a
tontine invested in the risk\-free asset dominates stock investments for older investors without a bequest motive.
However, with a bequest motive, it is optimal to replace the tontine investment over time with traditional
financial assets. Our results indicate that early in retirement, a tontine is only an attractive investment option,
if the tontine funds are invested in a risky asset. In this case, they crowd out stocks and risk\-free bonds in the
optimal portfolios of younger investors. Over time, the average optimal portfolio weight of tontines decreases.
Introducing systematic mortality risks noticeably reduces the peak allocation to tontines.

to withdraw when they experience a shock and also experience more shocks. Shocks are associated with about
20% of all retirement account withdrawals and exacerbate pre\-existing inequalities in financial preparation for

Despite higher monthly benefits for those who delay, many people still claim Social Security retirement benefits
at age 62, the earliest age of eligibility. This study uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine
thedemographicandoccupationalcharacteristicsassociatedwithearlyclaiming,aswellastheretirementincome
of early claimers compared with those who delay. The authors find that several work\-related factors may cause
people to claim Social Security benefits early and suggest they may face challenges in continuing to work at
older ages. For example, those who worked in physically demanding blue\-collar jobs were 55% more likely to
claim benefits prior to their full retirement age, after controlling for other factors, compared with those in all
other occupations. Other factors, such as having lower expectations of living to age 75 significantly increase
the likelihood of claiming early. The median income for those who claim at full retirement age or later was
45% higher after claiming benefits than for those who claimed early and 33% higher at age 72\. Even when
comparing early and delayed claimers with similar total income after claiming, average household income for
delayed claimers was higher at age 72 than for early claimers.

We look at an enhanced loss\-harvesting strategy, tax\-rate arbitrage, which exploits the differential between
short\- and long\-term tax rates. Our study relies on ATBAT, an After\-Tax Back\-Testing Analysis Tool that lets
us examine tax\-managed strategies over numerous historical periods. For the ideal tax\-rate arbitrage investor,
81one who is subject to federal only tax rates, who has a long horizon and a planned liquidation date, and who
launches the strategy from all cash, tax\-rate arbitrage generated an average of 0\.78% in excess after\-tax active
return at a 10\-year horizon relative to a standard loss\-harvesting strategy. Other investors with different profiles
may benefit from tax\-rate arbitrage but typically to a lesser extent.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management Research (2021\). Retirement Realities: Time For Change: Retirement Survey \&
Insights Report 2021 . Tech. rep. Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management released the findings of its Retirement Survey \& Insights Report, which seeks
to learn directly from plan participants about their experience preparing for, transitioning to, and managing
their finances in retirement.
The survey revealed that financial hardships have affected retirement savings for 89% of workers, compared
to 17% of retirees. More than half of the retirees polled retired earlier than expected, and health was the top
concern among retirees. The youngest respondents are expecting to leave the workforce much earlier, however,
with 25% of Generation Z respondents planning to retire before the age of 55\.
Overall, survey responses highlight the importance of employer retirement programs for both retired and cur\-
rently working individuals, with 56% of retired respondents (and 38% of working respondents) surveyed stating
that they derive their source of retirement education from employer retirement programs.
Responses were analyzed from two distinct populations: those currently in retirement and those currently work\-
ing, with the latter cohort spanning a range of age groups, including Generation X, Millennials and Generation
Z individuals, in geographies across the US.
Notable highlights from the report include:
1\)More than half of retired respondents retired earlier than expected and health was the top reason listed
for retired individuals. Health reasons topped the list of reasons for retirement, with 24% of respondents
forced into retirement due to health concerns, and with only 3% of respondents having worked longer than
expected. Notably, only 9% of participants indicated that having sufficient retirement savings is a key
trigger for retirement.
2\)Interruptedsavingsmaybecausingshortfallsinretirementplans.Eighty\-ninepercentofworkingindividuals
say financial hardships impacted their retirement savings, compared to 17% of retired individuals. Eighty\-
three percent of workers say paying down existing loans impacted their retirement savings, compared to
15% of retirees.
3\)Younger workers may need to plan with more realistic assumptions. Twenty\-five percent of Generation Z
respondents plan to retire before age 55, while roughly 30% of those under age 40 believe they need 60%
or less of their pre\-retirement income in retirement, compared to Generation X respondents, who feel they
need 80% of their pre\-retirement income in retirement.
4\)Employer\-sponsored retirement programs are the most used source of retirement education. Survey re\-
sponses highlight the importance of employer retirement programs for both retired and currently working
individuals, with 56% of retired respondents surveyed stating that they derive their source of retirement
education from employer retirement programs. Additionally, offering new programs or continuing to expand
on existing ones is an important value driver for any organization.
The survey was conducted between July and August 2021 in the United States, with responses from 1,237
participants (613 working Generation X, Millennials and Generation Z individuals and 624 retired individuals
(aged 60\-75\)).

specification .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
This paper defines key assumptions, derived from empirical data, to deliver highly accurate and representative
simulations of participant outcomes. The paper constructs an alternative glide path design that we believe more
efficiently balances major retirement savings risks \- longevity/shortfall, return sequence, and inflation \- than the
industry average glide path. The paper demonstrates that an alternative glide path \- one that begins with higher
equity allocations than the industry average, follows a steeper slope of asset shifts, and arrives at a risk\-parity
solution at the point of retirement– has less variability in outcomes than the industry average.
Goodman, B. and Richardson, D. P. (2019\). “Achieving Retirement Income Security: A Comparison of Guaranteed
Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit, Systematic Withdrawal and Partial Variable Annuity Strategies .” In:SSRN e\-
Print.
82Many retirement income products attempt to satisfy multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives because
retirees desire products that provide retirement security, inflation protection, liquidity, asset growth and the
potential for an estate. In this paper, we used historical data over the past 90 years to conduct simulations and
analyze how a Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB), systematic withdrawal, and partial Variable
Immediate Annuity (VIA) strategies performed in meeting these multiple objectives. With the exception of
retirement income starting dates at the beginning of the Great Depression, all three strategies performed well
in providing income throughout retired life. The partial VIA and GLWB strategies provided better ”peace of
mind” retirement income products, while the systematic withdrawal strategy offered the greatest flexibility in
managing retirement assets. Overall, we conclude that a partial VIA income strategy comprised of a VIA and
supplemental liquid asset account would have provided the best mixture of income generation, risk management,
and estate potential for the majority of cohorts.

This article provides a comparative test of two ways in which individual relative risk tolerance is commonly

Over the past decade robo\-advisors have gone from offerings from a handful of start\-ups to an established and
fast\-growing segment of the wealth management industry. Robo\-advisors use technology to translate core retail
investing principles\-establishing an investment plan, seeking broad diversification, weighting cost and value, and
accounting for taxes\-into automated platforms with easy\-to\-use interfaces. Intuitive user experience backed by
well\-established investment processes allow individual investors to create and execute investment strategies with
littleornointeractionwithafinancialprofessional,resultinginlargeeconomiesofscaleforrobo\-advisorsandlow

portfolios, manage risk, and optimize taxes. We discuss the implementation of goal\-based investing, socially
responsible (ESG) investing, and smart beta strategies on robo\-advisory platforms. Additionally, we examine
robo\-advisor performance during the market downturn in March 2020, the first significant market drawdown
since their introduction, and find portfolio performance in agreement with broadly diversified stock and bond
holdings. Consistent with expectations, robo\-advisors also reported increased tax\-loss harvesting activity during
this downturn.

Management 45(4\), pp. 83–90\.
In this article, the authors discuss a general method for ranking portfolios that places few limitations on the
portfolio constituents other than using publicly traded assets. The ranking scores reflect the expected reward
investors would require for accepting the risks of the portfolio in the context of an asset pricing framework.
The scores are computed through a factor model that acknowledges the factor return correlations. The authors
illustrate the approach with a large universe of exchange\-traded funds assuming a linear model with Fama\-
French\-Carhart factors wherein factor premiums (i.e., expected returns) are proportional to factor volatilities.
The empirical analysis implies that the most significant factors from the Fama\-French\-Carhart factor set driving
the premiums are the market and the momentum factors.

83annuities under stochastic volatility, stochastic interest rates and stochastic mortality via the componentwise
splitting method .” In:Quantitative Finance 19(3\), pp. 501–518\.
This paper values guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) riders embedded in variable annuities
assuming that the underlying fund dynamics evolve under the influence of stochastic interest rates, stochastic
volatility, stochastic mortality and equity risk. The valuation problem is formulated as a partial differential
equation (PDE) which is solved numerically by employing the operator splitting method. Sensitivity analysis of
the fair guarantee fee is performed with respect to various model parameters. We find that (i) the fair insurance
fee charged by the product provider is an increasing function of the withdrawal rate; (ii) the GMWB price
is higher when stochastic interest rates and volatility are incorporated in the model, compared to the case of
static interest rates and volatility; (iii) the GMWB price behaves non\-monotonically with changing volatility
of variance parameter; (iv) the fair fee increases with increasing volatility of interest rates parameter, and
increasing correlation between the underlying fund and the interest rates; (v) the fair fee increases when the
speed of mean\-reversion of stochastic volatility or the average long\-term volatility increases; (vi) the GMWB
fee decreases when the speed of mean\-reversion of stochastic interest rates or the average long\-term interest
rates increase. We investigate both static and dynamic (optimal) policyholder’s withdrawal behaviours; we
present the optimal withdrawal schedule as a function of the withdrawal account and the investment account
for varying volatility and interest rates. When incorporating stochastic mortality, we find that its impact on
the fair guarantee fee is rather small. Our results demonstrate the importance of correct quantification of risks
embedded in GMWBs and provide guidance to product providers on optimal hedging of various risks associated
with the contract.

Waterloo.
The thesis is written in response to emerging issues brought about by an increasing number of assets allocated
in a portfolio and seeks answers to puzzling empirical findings in the portfolio management area. Over the years,
researchers and practitioners working in the portfolio optimization area have been concerned with estimation
errors in the first two moments of asset returns. The thesis comprises several related chapters on our statistical
inquiry into this subject. Chapter 1 of the thesis contains an introduction to what will be reported in the
remaining chapters. A few well\-known covariance matrix estimation methods in the literature involve adjustment
of sample eigenvalues. Chapter 2 of the thesis examines the effects of sample eigenvalue adjustment on the out\-
of\-sample performance of a portfolio constructed from the sample covariance matrix.
Guo, D., Boyle, P. P., Weng, C., and Wirjanto, T. S. (2019\). “When Does The 1/N Rule Work? ” In:SSRN e\-Print .
We propose a ”1/N favorability index” to measure how favorable a market is to holding a 1/N portfolio. This
index reflects the extent of difficulty for an optimized portfolio to outperform the 1/N portfolio in a specific
market. A single\-factor model predicts that bull markets are accompanied by a high 1/N favorability index and
vice versa. We validate the model implication that the 1/N portfolio is more difficult to beat in bull markets
using stock return datasets from a number of countries as well as the classic datasets used by DeMiguel et al.
(2009\). Our results imply that the reported good performance of the 1/N portfolio in the US equity market can
be partially attributed to the long\-run bullish trend in the market which gives rise to the high favorability of
the market to the 1/N portfolio.

their retirement portfolio on their own. Therefore, they need to know the optimal amount of consumption they
can afford each year, and the optimal proportion of wealth they should invest in the financial market. In this
84project, we study the optimization strategy proposed by Delong and Chen (2016\). Their model determines
the optimal consumption and investment strategy for a retiree facing (1\) a minimum lifetime consumption,
(2\) a stochastic force of mortality following a geometric Brownian motion process, (3\) an annuity income, and
(4\) non\-exponential discounting of future income. We use a modified version of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
(1985\) model to capture the stochastic mortality intensity of the retiree and, subsequently, determine a new
optimal consumption and investment strategy using their framework. We use an expansion method to solve
the classic Hamilton\-Jacobi\-Bellman equation by perturbing the non\-exponential discounting parameter using
partial differential equations.

In this paper we employ a lifecycle model that uses utility of consumption and bequest to determine an optimal
Deferred Income Annuity (DIA) purchase policy. We lay out a mathematical framework to formalize the opti\-
mization process. The method and implementation of the optimization is explained, and the results are then
analyzed. We extend our model to control for asset allocation and show how the purchase policy changes when
one is allowed to vary asset allocation. Our results indicate that (i.) refundable DIAs are less appealing than
non\-refundable DIAs because of the loss of mortality credits; (ii.) the DIA allocation region is larger under the
fixed asset allocation strategy due to it becoming a proxy for fixed\-income allocation; and (iii.) when the investor
is allowed to change asset\-allocation, DIA allocation becomes less appealing. However, a case for higher DIA
allocation can be made for those individuals who perceive their longevity to be higher than the population.

stochastic as well as lifetimes, raising the question of whether their qualitative insights and approximations are
generalizable or practical.

In this article, the authors consider historical real returns of tax\-exempt portfolios consisting of equities and
short\-term bonds over 90 different 30\-year time periods from 1900 to 2018, in which fixed real contributions were
made to the portfolios annually. Two main types of portfolios are considered. The first is a portfolio in which
the investor annually contributed evenly between equities and bonds and never rebalanced the portfolio. The
second is a portfolio with Graham bands, in which the investor annually contributed evenly between equities and
bonds but rebalanced the portfolio to an overall 50/50 allocation whenever the equity or the bond portion of the
portfolio exceeded 75% of the overall portfolio value. The authors also consider analogous results when short\-
term bonds were replaced by less liquid guaranteed income instruments, such as TIAA Traditional, providing
higher yields. These results are intended to provide useful historical data to assist investors in the accumulation
phase and their advisors in asset allocation decisions.
Halen, N., Faust, K., and Taylor, T. (2020\). “Understanding the True Cost of Health Care in Retirement .” In:
Retirement Management Journal .
After years of working hard and diligently saving to prepare for retirement, many individuals expect they’ll
finally be able to slow down, pursue hobbies, and enjoy the next phase of their lives. However, the truth facing
retirees today is that numerous financial risks and uncertainties threaten their ability to spend their hard\-earned
85money and maintain the quality of life they desire. Perhaps the greatest worry for those in, or near, retirement
is whether they will be able to afford rising healthcare costs, particularly unplanned out\-of\-pocket expenses.
Retirees’ concerns around health care are not without merit, yet a closer look reveals a different picture. Our
research concludes that healthcare expenses for many retirees are a small percentage of total spending and are
far less variable than most people think, making them easier to plan for properly than conventional wisdom
suggests. Two healthcare\-related risks increase spending variability in retirement dramatically: long\-term care
events and longevity. An appropriate strategy for managing healthcare expenses in retirement is to plan for
known or diversifiable risks and insure the unknown or undiversifiable risks. This study has three primary
goals. First, to assess and quantify the variability of out\-of\-pocket healthcare costs to determine whether retiree
concerns around funding these expenses are warranted. Second, to identify what factors drive variability in
spending and quantify their potential financial impact. Third, to identify solutions financial professionals can
utilize with clients to reduce spending variability and achieve better outcomes in retirement.

naive can you be and still have successful out\-of\-sample portfolio performance? ” In:Annals of Finance 13,
pp. 341–353\.
Recent research reports that optimal portfolio selection models often perform worse than equal\-weight naive
diversification in out\-of\-sample testing. This paper extends this line of inquiry by comparing the out\-of\-sample
performance of the equal\-weight naive strategy to the out\-of\-sample performance of five alternative naive strate\-
gies,eachofwhichderivesfromasimpleheuristicthatdoesnotrequireanyoptimization.Out\-of\-sampleportfolio
performance is assessed by mean, standard deviation, skewness, and Sharpe ratio; k\-fold cross validation is used
as the out\-of\-sample testing mechanism. The results indicate that the proposed naive heuristic rules exhibit
strong out\-of\-sample performance, in most cases superior to the equal\-weight naive strategy. These findings are
consequential for at least two reasons: first, if these simple heuristic\-based rules outperform the equal\-weight
naive strategy, then by transitivity they can outperform the mean\-variance\- and shortfall\-optimal portfolio rules
that have been shown in the literature to be inferior to the equal\-weight naive rule, which further emphasizes the
out\-of\-sample fragility of ”optimal”methods; and second, among naive diversification strategies, some appear
more robust in out\-of\-sample testing than others, hence the proposed methods may be useful when forming
mixed portfolio selection models wherein a naive strategy is combined with an optimal strategy to improve
performance.

for a defined\-contribution pension plan with downside protection under stochastic inflation. The plan participant
invests the fund wealth and the stochastic interim contribution flows into the financial market. The nominal
interest rate model is described by the Cox Ingersoll Ross (Cox et al., 1985\) dynamics. To cope with the inflation
risk, the inflation indexed bond is included in the asset menu. The retired individuals receive an annuity that
is indexed by inflation and a downside protection on the amount of this annuity is considered. The closed\-form
solution is derived under the CRRA utility function. Finally, a numerical application is presented to characterize
the dynamic behavior of the optimal investment strategy. We model the optimal asset allocation for DC pension
plan under inflation. A minimum guarantee on the amount of retirement annuity is considered. We emphasize
the importance of the inflation\-indexed bond in the pension portfolio. The investments in indexed bonds would
increase with the risk\-aversion. The investments in indexed bonds would increase with the guarantee provided.
Hanna, S. and Kim, K. T. (2017\). “Treatment of Inflation in Retirement Planning Calculations: An Improved
Method.” In:Journal of Financial Planning 30(1\), pp. 44–53\.
The typical treatment of inflation in retirement planning textbooks is complex and often not reasonable in terms
oftheamounttocontribute,thefirstyearbeingdependentontheinflationrateassumption. Thetypicalfinancial
planning approach requires an assumption about the future inflation rate, which can be difficult to justify based
on the economic history in the United States and other countries. Economists typically put all amounts and
interest rates in inflation\-adjusted terms, which is simpler and can be a more rational approach to long\-term
planning. It can be difficult to comprehend the meaning of future amounts in nominal terms; therefore, doing
projections in inflation\-adjusted terms may help clients better understand projections. In calculating the capital
needs for retirement, inflation\-adjusted rates of return for each step should be chosen based on portfolio choices
appropriate for before and after retirement.

sity.
The vulnerability of individuals planning for retirement has been growing due to the conversion from defined\-
benefit plans to defined\-contribution plans, the steady increase in life longevity, and the uncertainty of asset
returns under an ever\-changing global environment. A serious problem is the lack of appropriate planning for
retirement. How much should an individual save beyond the Social Security tax in order to maintain a reasonable
lifestyle after retirement? This paper designs a framework to facilitate the process of setting realistic goals for
financial planning, featuring the concept of agent\-based simulations. The framework also provides policy\-rule
guidelines for the agent to search for an optimal strategy. Additionally, a micro\-macro analysis enables us to
analyze a cohort of representative agents and aggregate the individual results on the macro\-level. The simulation
module employs a regime\-based Monte Carlo simulation of multiple asset categories, a factor\-based diversifying
asset allocation approach, and a collection of dynamic policy\-rule\-based investment strategies. Empirical results,
consisting of a downside risk simulation for university endowments, a sustainability assessment for the Social
Security fund, and a personal goal\-based retirement planning, demonstrate stylized applications of the planning
framework.

Vanguard.
RetireesintheUKfacemorechallengestodaythaneverbeforewhenitcomestoretirementplanning.Thedecline
of defined benefit pensions in favour of less expensive (for the employer) defined contribution plans, pension
freedoms, increased longevity and other factors have made retirement planning considerably more complex.
Arguably foremost among these challenges is how to convert the retiree’s accumulated retirement savings into
a sustainable income that may need to last 30 years or more.While reducing spending and working longer are
the most effective ways of extending the life of a retirement portfolio, increasing the portfolio’s net after\-tax
return can also have apositive impact. One way to accomplish this is to select the proper withdrawal order when
deciding which accounts to spend from. This paper looks at three withdrawal orders across three crystallisation
strategies. Using our Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM), we simulate the impact of withdrawal order
and crystallisation strategy on a number of success metrics over a 30\-year time horizon. Our analysis shows that,
for most investors, withdrawing from taxable accounts first provides the best results.

pp. 51–59\.
Retirees can file for Social Security benefits as soon as they are 62 years old, but payments will become larger if
they delay up to a maximum of 70 years of age. Many people believe the best strategy is to wait until later to
file in order to maximize benefit payments. In this article, we reexamine that advice and add two considerations.
First, we discuss how the claiming decision is made and recognize that in many cases the individual’s goal
is to support new lifestyle options, not to maximize Social Security withdrawals. Next, we consider alternative
sourcesofincomeand howusingthose resourcesaffectsthe claimingdecision. Thearticleconcludes withexample

Applications .” In:The Review of Asset Pricing Studies 10(2\), pp. 199–248\.
In almost every area of empirical finance, researchers confront multiple tests. One high\-profile example is the
identification of outperforming investment managers, many of whom beat their benchmarks purely by luck.
Multiple testing methods are designed to control for luck. Factor selection is another glaring case in which
multiple tests are performed, but numerous other applications do not receive as much attention. One important
example is a simple regression model testing five variables. In this case, because five variables are tried, a t\-
statistic of 2\.0 is not enough to establish significance. Our paper provides a guide to various multiple testing
methods and details a number of applications. We provide simulation evidence on the relative performance of
different methods across a variety of testing environments. The goal of our paper is to provide a menu that
researchers can choose from to improve inference in financial economics.

Large Portfolios of Variable Annuities .” In:arXiv e\-Print .
Variable Annuity (VA) products expose insurance companies to considerable risk because of the guarantees they
provide to buyers of these products. Managing and hedging these risks requires insurers to find the value of key
risk metrics for a large portfolio of VA products. In practice, many companies rely on nested Monte Carlo (MC)
87simulations to find key risk metrics. MC simulations are computationally demanding, forcing insurance com\-
panies to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in computational infrastructure per year. Moreover, existing
academic methodologies are focused on fair valuation of a single VA contract, exploiting ideas in option theory
and regression. In most cases, the computational complexity of these methods surpasses the computational re\-
quirements of MC simulations. Therefore, academic methodologies cannot scale well to large portfolios of VA
contracts. In this paper, we present a framework for valuing such portfolios based on spatial interpolation. We
provide a comprehensive study of this framework and compare existing interpolation schemes. Our numerical
results show superior performance, in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy, for these methods
compared to nested MC simulations. We also present insights into the challenge of finding an effective inter\-
polation scheme in this framework, and suggest guidelines that help us build a fully automated scheme that is
efficient and accurate.

of Portfolio Management 46(4\), pp. 81–93\.
Two tests can help asset managers to develop more robust investment strategies: an impact test and a survival
test. Both tests complement the backtest, in which one checks how a proposed investment strategy would have
performed in the past. The impact test considers the performance of the strategy when assets under management
grow (crowdedness), and it checks the impact that growth in assets under management in competing strategies
has on the proposed strategy (cross impact). The survival test considers the effect of the long\-term evolution
of assets under management in competition for market capital. Using Shiller S\&P 500 index and bond market
data, we show that time\-series momentum (relative strength) performs best in the backtest and the impact test
but that an expected relative cash\-flow rule (relative dividend yield) has the best long\-term survival properties.

Often clients try to quantify what good financial advice is worth. After all, how do you determine if the value
of the service is greater than its cost? However, this is a tricky proposition, as it depends on how you define
”good”. Nevertheless, several reports have broached this topic and I have attempted to give a brief overview of
the strengths and weaknesses of a few that I believe are quite substantive. Clients should aim to understand
these reports in the context of their own personal situation. Identify your own personal areas that require the
most support and think about if you are are getting all of the focus that you need.

How should clients use tax\-advantaged accounts? By quantifying the tax benefits of those accounts, we can refine
recommendations on asset location and the traditional\-versus\-Roth decision. Specifically, low\-return assets, even
if otherwise taxed at high rates, may not benefit much from being placed in tax\-advantaged accounts. Also, the
choice between traditional and Roth contributions is asymmetric: Traditional accounts provide an opportunity
for a higher tax benefit, but risk incurring a tax cost. Roth contributions provide greater certainty of a positive
tax benefit.

The Ethical Issues in Retirement Income Planning study gathered the perceptions of expert retirement income

with the retirement planning profession ethical climate, as 64% of respondents believed that the overall ethical
culture in the retirement income industry was solid as compared to 36% that expressed some concern. However,
advisors were not without concerns. When asked to rank those concerns, a dominant theme emerged through the
surveyquantitativeandqualitativefindings:Respondentsbelievedthatethicalviolationsweretheresultofalack

elder abuse. Respondents were not overly concerned that financial advisors were the primary perpetrators but
were worried about the industry ability to identify cases of financial elder abuse and exploitation, noting that
88most retirement advisors had not been adequately trained to recognize the signs of abuse, which are often subtle
and ambiguous. Respondents reported that they saw very few acts of outright fraud or deceit. Respondents
generally believed that retirement advisors, while well\-intentioned, often lacked sufficient knowledge in three
main areas: Social Security, Medicare, and tax planning. They feared that these knowledge limitations might
lead practitioners to make recommendations that were not in the best interest of their clients. An additional
and related concern was that consumers would not be able to act as a check since in many cases they lacked
the financial literacy to understand the complex products or plans offered to them. In some cases, clients simply
trusted their advisor and remained disengaged from the planning process. Respondents also perceived that this
level of client dependence reflected a general lack of understanding of the financial advisor pivotal role in the
process of planning for retirement.

Until recently, the issue of tax\-efficient investing has been largely overlooked by the mainstream literature. And
simple heuristics to guide investors and their advisors are not always as obvious as they might initially seem.
This monograph explores central issues surrounding the use of tax\-deferred investment accounts as a means of
accumulating wealth and presents a useful framework, grounded in basic time\-value\-of\-money concepts, that can
be readily implemented by investment professionals (U.S. as well as non\-U.S. based) in various tax environments

Saving, Investment, and Retirement Behavior .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
This Chapter explores how an environment of persistent low returns influences saving, investing, and retirement
behaviors, as compared to what in the past had been thought of as more ”normal” financial conditions. Our
calibrated lifecycle dynamic model with realistic tax, minimum distribution, and Social Security benefit rules
produces results that agree with observed saving, work, and claiming age behavior of U.S. households. In par\-
ticular, our model generates a large peak at the earliest claiming age at 62, as in the data. Also in line with the
evidence, our baseline results show a smaller second peak at the (system\-defined) Full Retirement Age of 66\.
In the context of a zero\-return environment, we show that workers will optimally devote more of their savings
to non\-retirement accounts and less to 401(k) accounts, since the relative appeal of investing in taxable versus
tax\-qualified retirement accounts is lower in a low return setting. Finally, we show that people claim Social
Security benefits later in a low interest rate environment.

Optimal versus Default Longevity Income Annuities .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
A recent US Treasury regulation allowed deferred longevity income annuities to be included in pension plan
menus as a default payout solution, yet little research has investigated whether more people should convert
some of the 15 trillion they hold in employer\-based defined contribution plans into lifelong income streams.
We investigate this innovation using a calibrated lifecycle consumption and portfolio choice model embodying
realistic institutional considerations. Our welfare analysis shows that defaulting a small portion of retirees 401(k)
assets (over a threshold) is an attractive way to enhance retirement security, enhancing welfare by up to 20% of
retiree plan accruals.

89Tax\-qualified vehicles helped U.S. private\-sector workers accumulate $25Tr in retirement assets. An often\-
overlooked important institutional feature shaping decumulations from these retirement plans is the ”Required
Minimum Distribution” (RMD) regulation, requiring retirees to withdraw a minimum fraction from their retire\-
ment accounts or pay excise taxes on withdrawal shortfalls. Our calibrated lifecycle model measures the impact
of RMD rules on financial behavior of heterogeneous households during their worklives and retirement. We show
that proposed reforms to delay or eliminate the RMD rules should have little effects on consumption profiles
but more impact on withdrawals and tax payments for households with bequest motives.

and annuitization in retirement portfolios .” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 42(1\), pp. 396–408\.
Financial advisers have developed standardized payout strategies to help Baby Boomers manage their money in
their golden years. Prominent among these are phased withdrawal plans offered by mutual funds including the
self\-annuitization or default rules encouraged under US tax law, and fixed payout annuities offered by insurers.
Using a utility\-based framework, and taking account of stochastic capital markets and uncertain lifetimes, we
first evaluate these rules on a stand\-alone basis for a wide range of risk aversion. Next, we permit the consumer to
integrate these standardized payout strategies at retirement and compare the results. We show that integrated
strategies can enhance retirees’ well\-being by 25 percent 50 percent for low/moderate levels of risk aversion
when compared to full annuitization at retirement. Finally, we examine how welfare changes if the consumer is
permitted to switch to a fixed annuity at an optimal point after retirement. This affords the retiree the chance
to benefit from the equity premium when younger, and exploit the mortality credit in later life. For moderately
risk\-averse retirees, the optimal switching age lies between 80 and 85\.

We construct a unified objective measure of health status: the frailty index, defined as the cumulative sum of
all adverse health indicators observed for an individual. Using this index, we document four stylized facts on
health dynamics over the life cycle and show that they are robust to other ways of constructing the index. We
also compare the frailty index with self\-reported health status and find significant differences in their dynamics
and ability to predict health\-related outcomes. Finally, we propose and estimate a stochastic process for frailty
dynamics over the life cycle accounting for mortality bias. Our frailty measure and dynamic process can be used
to study the evolution of health over the life cycle and its economic implications.

Retirees with limited financial resources face numerous risks, including out\-living their money (longevity risk),
investment losses (market risk), unexpected health expenses (health risk), the unforeseen needs of family mem\-
bers (family risk), and even retirement benefit cuts (policy risk). This study systematically values and ranks the
financial impacts of these risks from both the objective and subjective perspectives and then compares them to
show the gaps between retirees’ actual risks and their perceptions of the risks in a unified framework. It finds
that 1\) under the empirical analysis, the greatest risk is longevity risk, followed by health risk; 2\) under the
subjective analysis, retirees perceive market risk as the highest\-ranking risk due to their exaggeration of market
volatility; and 3\) the longevity risk and health risk are valued less in the subjective ranking than in the objective
ranking, because retirees underestimate their life spans and their health costs in late life.

Data\-Snooping Bias? Tech. rep. Institute of Economics Academia Sinica.
This study examines the possible data\-snooping bias as a competing explanation for the anomalies in the cross\-
section of stock returns. We posit that the exhaustive standalone searches for profitable strategies could lead
to recommending spuriously predictive variables. In order to explore the severity of this problem, we use a
multiple testing method to evaluate the profitability of portfolios constructed by these predictors. Our empirical
analyses suggest that over half of the findings based on individual testing method are no longer statistically
significant after we adjust for data\-snooping bias. Excluding the micro\-cap stocks before portfolios construction
and applying the notion of economic significance in this study further weaken the evidence for predictability.

In:Journal of Banking \& Finance 97, pp. 257–269\.
Using a series of advanced tests from White’s (2000\) Check to correct for data\-snooping bias, we assess the out\-
of\-sample performance of various portfolio strategies relative to the naive 1/N rule. When we analyze 16 basic
portfolio strategies, 126 learning strategies, and nearly 2,000 extended strategies, we find that some strategies
90outperform the 1/N rule in conventional tests that do not account for data\-snooping bias. However, after we use
the new tests that control for such bias, we find that none or very few of these strategies outperform the 1/N
rule. Thus, our finding underscores the necessity to control for data\-snooping bias when making asset allocation
decisions.
Hu, W. (2021\). “A Comprehensive Study of Guaranteed Minimum Maturity Benefit and Guaranteed Minimum
Death Benefit under Regime\-switching Models .” PhD thesis. North Carolina State University.
In this dissertation, we investigate the pricing and hedging of Guaranteed Minimum Benefits (GMBs) in life
annuity products, and we extend the existing framework by assuming the underlying asset dynamics evolve
under a regime\-switching jump\-diffusion environment. First, two most popular GMB contracts, Guaranteed
Minimum Maturity Benefit (GMMB) and Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB), are characterized by
comprehensive quantitative models that assess both the market risk on the liability side and the revenue risk
on the asset side from the viewpoint of insurers. Then, five stochastic mortality models (Cox\-Ingersoll\-Ross
process model, Vasicek process model, Ornstein\-Uhlenbeck process model, Feller process model and a two\-
factor mortality model) are utilized to describe the mortality risk embedded in GMBs, and their parameters
are estimated by calibrating to the mortality data of the United States male population. After comparing the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) criteria, we find that the Feller
process model fits the real data best among the five models. In addition, numeric solutions for net liabilities, fair
rate of fees and Greeks (sensitivities of net liabilities with respect to model parameters) of GMMB and GMDB
are derived by an accurate and fast Fourier Space Timestepping (FST) algorithm. Numerical results based on
Monte Carlo simulations are also provided for comparative purpose. Moreover, an unhedged and three statically
hedged portfolios which are constructed by different methods (linear algebra method, optimization method and
regularization method) are introduced, and their performances are assessed by comparing the short\-term and
the long\-term volatility, Value\-at\-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (CVaR). The results indicate that, in the
short\-term, the portfolio constructed by optimization method performs the best and all three hedged portfolios
perform better than unhedged portfolio in the long\-term. Finally, these hedging results provide insurers some
guidelines to hedge according to their risk tolerances. For example, if an insurer is more concerned about the
short\-term volatility, a linear algebra method is preferred although it requires frequent rebalancing. In addition,
if one is more concerned about the transaction cost, a optimization method is more preferable and it does not
need to be rebalanced every year. The regularization method is suitable for an incomplete market which only
have few instruments for hedging.
Huang, H. and Milevsky, M. A. (2016\). “Longevity risk and retirement income tax efficiency: A location spending
rate puzzle .” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 71, pp. 50–62\.
In this paper we model and solve a retirement consumption problem with differentially taxed accounts, parame\-
terized by longevity risk aversion. The work is motivated by some observations on how Canadians de\-accumulate
financial wealth during retirement which seem rather puzzling. While the Modigliani lifecycle model can jus\-
tify a variety of (pre\-tax) de\-accumulation or draw down rates depending on risk preferences, the existence of
asymmetric taxes implies that certain financial accounts should be depleted faster than others. Our analysis of
data from the Survey of Financial Security indicates that Canadian retirees maintain approximately two\-thirds
of their financial wealth in tax\-sheltered accounts and a third in taxable accounts regardless of age. The ratio of
taxable to tax\-sheltered wealth increases slightly or remains relatively constant depending on household income
which is not what one would expect from the lifecycle model. Indeed, using our model we cannot locate a plausi\-
ble tax function that justifies a constant \- account ratio \- regardless of age. For example under flat rates taxable
accounts should be depleted well before tax\-sheltered accounts are ever touched. The account ratio should go
to zero quite rapidly in the absence of government mandated withdrawals. We also demonstrate that under
progressive income taxes withdrawals are made from both accounts but at different rates depending on account
size, pension income and longevity risk preferences. Again, the \- account ratio \- should eventually decline. We
postulate that this sort of behavior is likely due to irrational considerations linked to mental accounting, etc. It
remains to be seen whether this will persist over time and under a more careful analysis of Canadian cohorts or
if retirees in other countries exhibit the same behavior.

Security Retirement Benefits . Tech. rep. Centre For Research On Successful Ageing, Singapore Management
University.
This paper examines the impact of changes in house prices on when eligible individuals start receiving Social
Security benefits. If house prices increase, financially constrained households may draw upon the additional
home equity to finance expenses and delay receipt of Social Security in order to have increased lifetime monthly
benefits. To address concerns that house price changes are correlated with unobserved local demand shocks,
we use a control function approach and employ two different instrumental variables. We find that individuals
delay Social Security claiming when house prices increase during the housing boom. The probability of claiming
within two years after becoming eligible decreases by 8\.67\-8\.81 percent for every 10 percent increase in house
prices. We also find that the total home loan amount increases in response to the price appreciation, indicating
households are drawing upon their home equity to finance consumption and delay receiving Social Security.
Huaxiong, H., Milevsky, M. A., and Salisbury, T. S. (2017\). “Retirement Spending and Biological Age .” In:SSRN
e\-Print.
We solve a retirement lifecycle model in which the consumer’s age does not move in lockstep with calendar time.
Instead, biological age increases at a stochastic non\-linear rate in chronological age, which one can think of as
working with a clock that occasionally moves backwards in time. Our paper is inspired by the growing body of
medical literature that has identified biomarkers of aging which – practically speaking – offer better estimates
of expected remaining lifetime and future mortality rates. It isn’t farfetched to argue that in the not\-too\-distant
future of wearable technology, personal age will be more closely associated with biological time vs. calendar age
or time. Thus, after introducing our stochastic mortality model we derive optimal consumption rates in a classic
Yaari (1965\) framework adjusted to our proper clock and time. In addition to the normative implications of
having access to biological age, our positive objective is to partially explain the cross\-sectional heterogeneity in
retirement spending rates at any given chronological age. In sum, we argue that biological age is not a sufficient
statistic for making economic decisions and you need information about both your ages to behave rationally.

A global study of over 200 professional financial advisors is undertaken to test how risk profile factors are used to
make investment portfolio allocation recommendations. When presented with identical risk profile information,
similar to what a competent financial advisor would normally collect from a prospective client, respondents
are asked to recommend a portfolio allocation among equity, fixed income, and cash for five hypothetical client
scenarios. The results find that financial advisors, using their professional judgment, inconsistently puzzled
together the presented risk profile factors into portfolio recommendations, on average doing little more than
applying the heuristic 100\-minus\-age rule to recommendations. These troubling results highlight the regulatory
need for uniform risk profile evaluation guidance in fiduciary contexts.

identifies and tests conditions for these strategies to be optimal and confirm their economic relevance. We also
discuss why policy intervention to reduce the incidence of closing down, although feasible, is not warranted.

Journal of Operational Research 265(1\), pp. 372–388\.
It is well documented in portfolio optimization that naive diversification outperforms optimal mean\-variance
diversification because the latter is subject to severe estimation error. Our study provides an alternative expla\-
nation for the outperformance of naive diversification by examining the tail risk of naive diversification relative
to optimal mean\-variance diversification. We utilize a rolling\-sample approach and compare the out\-of\-sample
performance and tail risk of various optimal strategies to that of the naive diversification strategy. Using port\-
folios consisting of individual stocks, we show that for portfolios containing relatively small number of stocks,
naive diversification outperforms optimal mean\-variance diversification and is less exposed to tail risk. However,
for relatively large number of stocks in the portfolio, naive diversification maintains its superior performance but
increases tail risk and results in more concave portfolio returns. These results imply that the outperformance of
naive diversification acts as compensation for the increase in tail risk and concavity.

contribution is required over a full working life to achieve a decent retirement income, calculated as 23% of
average UK earnings. Another RoT is that each 1% of earnings provides a pension of 1\.5% of earnings. Other
RoTs show how costs vary by retirement age and if the saver’s retirement planning is on track. The current high
cost of pensions is partly due to low interest rates and the inefficiencies of the DC market, with inadequate bulk
purchasing power and risk sharing. RoTs might help encourage higher employer contributions, either through
automatic enrolment or on a voluntary basis.
Iannarone, N. G. (2018\). “Rethinking automated investment adviser disclosure .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Today, investment advisers, including robo\-advisers, push dense disclosures to consumer investors who may
not be able to fully comprehend their import. Tomorrow, robo\-advisers and their innovative technology, if
embraced by regulators and consumers, can facilitate and cultivate a trusted collaborative relationship between
investor and adviser where the adviser learns from the investor and provides education tailored to the investor,
helping to solve vexing consumer protection issues and lessen the impending retirement crisis. More and more
of us are comfortable making decisions without human involvement and entirely through a digital interface.
Despite consumers increasing comfort relying upon machines to direct and guide their decisions, most Americans
nevertheless lack basic foundational knowledge in finance and investing. Even those Americans who are able to
save for retirement lack financial sophistication and may not be able to understanding the complex products in
which they are invested. Robo advice may not be the solution for these problems, as robo\-advisers present a
potential black box problem where the digital investment advisers may not be capable of explanation beyond
the information input and advice output. In such a world, it is not only the new technology that should be
questioned. The existing standards through which the new technology is regulated should similarly be explored.
An understanding of potential benefits and potential harms may provide lessons that better allow us to protect
consumer investors and better prepare for the so\-called retirement crisis. This essay explores the parameters of
the pre\-existing regulatory regime as applied to a new landscape of investing with a focus on the key regulatory
tool of disclosure. This short essay examines the challenges of delivering appropriate disclosures in a new world
of robo\-advisory advice. It suggests a reconceptualization of the aim of disclosure to capitalize on robo\-advisers
ability to truly know their clients and shift the burden of investor education from the customer to a fiduciary
level adviser capable of tailoring advice and education to each investor at a level she is capable of understanding.
The essay concludes with a recommendation: robo\-advisers and investor collaboration via an active and iterative
disclosure regime that encourages investor comprehension, understanding, and learning.

93With target date funds widely expected to account for more than 50 percent of all defined contribution assets in
the near future, it is difficult to overstate their importance on the retirement security of America. Yet there are
very few tools and statistics for monitoring and evaluating target date funds. This article highlights a previously
unrecognized characteristic of target date fund families: Glide paths aren’t necessarily stable over time, and in
some cases change dramatically. We document the stability, or lack of stability, of the glide paths for the largest
target date fund families and introduce quantitative measures of glide path stability, including our preferred
measure, the Glide Path Stability Score.

Ilmanen, A. and Rauseo, M. (2018\). “Intelligent Risk Taking .” In:How Persistent Low Returns Will Shape Saving
and Retirement . Oxford University Press.
Peoples’ ability to consume in retirement is a function of how much they save, how they invest, and what
those investments return over the lifecycle. This chapter explores what rate of return is needed to deliver a
comfortable retirement based on current savings rates, as well as intelligent ways to construct portfolios to
achieve this rate of return. Based on reasonable long\-term return assumptions, defined contribution portfolios as
frequently constructed today are unlikely to achieve this required rate of return. By relaxing existing constraints
and taking advantage of well\-known and broadly accepted investment themes, this required rate of return can be
achieved with a well\-diversified portfolio, which may lead to a more consistent portfolio across different economic
environments.
Irlam, G. (2020a). “Lifetime Portfolio Selection: Using Machine Learning .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
The first half of this paper provides a primer on machine learning and relates it to problems in financial
planning. Machine learning proves capable of handling real world complications and details which classical
financial planning approaches cannot handle; e.g. taxes, reversion to the mean, and time varying yield curves.
The second half of this paper provides a case study of the use of reinforcement learning for making asset
allocation, annuitization, and consumption decisions in retirement planning. Machine learning typically delivers
within a few percent of the theoretical optimal solution on highly abstract problems. Machine learning is found
to outperform other approaches for more complex financial planning problems whose optimal solution is not
known. The value of SPIAs and inflationindexed bonds is highlighted by the machine learning approach.
Irlam, G. (2020b). “Machine learning for retirement planning .” In:The Journal of Retirement 8(1\), pp. 32–29\.
Machine learning provides a new approach to solving problems in many fields. This article explores the use of
machine learning to solve the retirement portfolio problem: deciding how much wealth to consume and how to
allocate the remainder. After first reviewing existing approaches to the portfolio problem, this article looks in
detail at the use of reinforcement learning. For simple financial scenarios where the optimal solution is known,
reinforcement learning is found to deliver to within a few percent of the optimal solution. For more compli\-
cated financial scenarios, with no known optimal solution, reinforcement learning outperforms other common
approaches. Reinforcement learning proves capable of optimizing highly complex financial models, including the
effects of income taxes, mean\-reverting asset classes, and time\-varying bond yield curves, all of which other
approaches cannot handle. Reinforcement learning appears to be the first fundamentally new approach to the
portfolio problem in over 50 years.

Financial planning via deep reinforcement learning holds much promise. One implementation, AIPlanner, deliv\-
ered near optimal financial results, but had a major shortcoming. It required training a separate neural network
model for each financial scenario. This paper describes extending AIPlanner so that a small family of trained
neural network models are capable of rapidly producing financial plans for a wide variety of financial scenarios.
Additionally AIPlanner is extended to produce results over the lifecycle, both pre and post retirement, and for
couples, as well as individuals. A reasonably realistic income tax model is incorporated. And finally, a more real\-
istic stock model is used. Over the lifecycle, compared to the best discovered alternative strategy, reinforcement
learning was found to effectively deliver 14% more retirement consumption.

Journal of Retirement 1(4\), pp. 118–128\.
Research on retirement income planning has, for many years, followed two separate tracks. Financial planning
practitioners have developed guidelines for withdrawals from savings and asset allocation by testing and fine\-
tuning various rules of thumb. Economists have applied a different approach, based on life\-cycle finance, aimed at
maximizing the utility of lifetime consumption, using dynamic programming techniques to optimize retirement
withdrawals and asset allocations. This article seeks to use a non\-mathematical explanation to help financial
planners and others who are not familiar with the economics approach to develop a conceptual understanding of
how life\-cycle finance and dynamic programming can be applied to retirement income planning. It also compares
the performance of optimized recommendations produced by dynamic programming with various rule\-of\-thumb
strategies that have been popular in the planning literature. It attempts to demonstrate the power that the
economics approach can bring to improving retirement income planning and argues that more communication
between economists and practitioners can help open up new approaches to research and improved practical
applications.

We develop and simulate a stochastic lifecycle model to investigate optimal annuity purchases at retirement.
Retirees can invest in risky assets, purchase fairly priced immediate or deferred lifetime annuities, and are
eligible for a targeted safety net pension. We match baseline parameters to current Australian settings and
conduct scenario analyses over a wide range of individual preferences and financial market outcomes. Except
where individuals need to insure a consumption floor, both immediate and deferred annuity purchases are
largely crowded out by the means\-tested public pension. Welfare losses caused by zero annuitisation are small
compared with the losses caused by completely annuitising all savings, particularly if wealth at retirement is
low. Decumulation policy should ensure individuals are well informed of the insurance value of annuities and
accommodate diverse choices.

goals\-based approach to retirement spending . Tech. rep. Vanguard.
Although the population and life expectancies of U.S. retirees are increasing, portfolio yields remain at histor\-
ically low levels. As defined benefit income becomes less commonly available, the need for informed retirement
portfolio spending strategies is more critical, and yet more complex, than ever. The stakes are high, and the
impact of subpar decisions can be severe. Because every investor’s financial situation is unique, there is no
one\-size\-fits\-all solution. But developing and implementing a personal spending strategy can reduce anxiety and
stress about the ability to meet retirement income goals. Retirees who hold the majority of their assets in tax\-
deferred accounts can turn thoseassets into income by setting up an automatic withdrawal plan. They can also
purchase an investment specifically designed to provide regular distributions. Those whose portfolios contain a
significant portion of taxable assets can add value by working with an advisor to develop a goals\-based strategy.
Whatever spending strategy you choose, the complexity and consequences of the process underscore the need
for and value of skillful guidance.

for diversified portfolio construction by explainable AI .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
In this paper, we construct a pipeline to investigate heuristic diversification strategies in asset allocation. We
use machine learning concepts (”explainable AI”) to compare the robustness of different strategies and back
out implicit rules for decision making.In a first step, we augment the asset universe (the empirical dataset)
with a range of scenarios generated with a block bootstrap from the empirical dataset.Second, we backtest the
candidate strategies over a long period of time, checking their performance variability. Third, we use XGBoost
as a regression model to connect the difference between the measured performances between two strategies to
a pool of statistical features of the portfolio universe tailored to the investigated strategy. Finally, we employ
95the concept of Shapley values to extract the relationships that the model could identify between the portfolio
characteristics and the statistical properties of the asset universe. We test this pipeline for studying risk\-parity
strategies with a volatility target, and in particular, comparing the machine learning\-driven Hierarchical Risk
Parity (HRP) to the classical Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) strategy.In the augmented dataset built from
a multi\-asset investment universe of commodities, equities and fixed income futures, we find that HRP better
matches the volatility target, and shows better risk\-adjusted performances. Finally, we train XGBoost to learn
the difference between the realized Calmar ratios of HRP and ERC and extract explanations.The explanations
provide fruitful ex\-post indications of the connection between the statistical properties of the universe and
the strategy performance in the training set. For example, the model confirms that features addressing the
hierarchical properties of the universe are connected to the relative performance of HRP respect to ERC.

We construct investment glide paths for a retirement plan using both traditional asset classes and deferred
annuities (DAs). The glide paths are approximated by averaging the asset proportions of stochastic optimal
investment solutions. The objective function consists of power utility in terms of secured retirement income
from purchased DAs, as well as a bequest that can be withdrawn before retirement. Compared with conventional
glide paths and investment strategies, our DA\-enhanced glide paths provide the investor with higher welfare
gains, more efficient investment portfolios and more responsive retirement income patterns and bequest levels
to different fee structures and personal preferences.

dynamic investment strategy to the needs of individual clients. They argue that this approach is superior to
the \- one\-size\-fits\-all,\- target\-date\-oriented static allocation path used in most current life cycle funds. They
present the two pillars of their approach: the methodology for obtaining financial and economic scenarios, and
the methodology of the goal\-oriented dynamic allocation strategy. This approach reduces the risks and improves
the feasibility of meeting the clients’ goals.

In:The Journal of Wealth Management 4(3\), pp. 14–29\.
The authors start with a simple question: what is the value of an individual’s assets that can be used to satisfy
retirement income needs, focusing more specifically on Social Security benefits? Consistent with an approach
introduced in earlier works published in The Journal of Wealth Management, they then ask how these benefits
affect the individual’s current asset mix. In particular, they delve further into earlier conclusions that the
present value of projected Social Security payments be included as a ’bond’ in personal portfolios. They note
that individuals’ portfolios are usually substantially different when the value of Social Security is included than
when it is excluded, and demonstrate that the profession has been miscalculating individuals’ ”true”portfolios
by excluding Social Security. If individuals optimize their traditional portfolios, which exclude Social Security,
then they have excessively conservative, sub\-optimal true \-portfolios.

We study an optimal consumption, investment, life insurance, and retirement decision of an economic agent who
has an option to retire early any time before the mandatory retirement date. We conduct a thorough theoretical
analysis for the optimal retirement problem with general utility function in the presence of mandatory retirement
date, which leads to the optimal stopping problem in finite horizon. Furthermore, different marginal utility of
consumption before and after retirement is considered, which can provide an explanation for the retirement\-
consumption puzzle, while it makes the problem technically more challenging. Based on the theory of partial
differential equation, we analyze the variational inequality arising from the dual problem and establish the
duality theorem. We show that the optimal retirement decision is determined by the time\-varying optimal
retirement wealth boundary, and we provide an integral equation representation for the optimal retirement
wealth boundary, which can be solved accurately and efficiently by using recursive integration method. As an
extension, the case with stochastic labor income is also considered. The properties of the optimal strategies are
provided with emphasis on the role of the mandatory retirement date and the impact of having a retirement
option on the optimal financial decisions.

96PurposeThepurposeofthispaperistocomparesimpledynamicwithdrawalstrategieswiththestaticwithdrawal
method, examining not only failure rates and ending wealth but also spending. All withdrawal strategies are
adjusted for the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) required minimum distribution (RMD). In addition, this
study investigates the use of small company stocks (SCS) in place of large company stocks (LCS). Results
indicate SCS portfolios are superior to large. When returns are poor, some dynamic strategies will not ensure
income for life. This study demonstrates that the simplest dynamic strategy is superior to two popular dynamic
strategies. Design/methodology/approach Using historical overlapping periods, different withdrawal strategies
are examined. Previous studies focused on failure rates and ending wealth. As discussed in Milevsky (2016\)
different statistical distributions can have similar tail properties (prob of failure) but dissimilar risk and return
profile. The detailed examination of both spending and use of small stocks advances the literature in this area.
Findings Results indicate that use of small stocks is superior to using large stocks in the portfolios. When US
historical stock returns are adjusted downward, there is the potential that some dynamic strategies will not
ensure income for life. This study demonstrates that the simplest dynamic strategy is superior to two popular
dynamic strategies. Originality/value This paper is the first to examine, in detail, annual spending results for the
retiree. Second, it is shown that, overall, SCS are superior to LCS for all stock/bond allocations. Even though
absolute downside risk increases slightly, this increase in downside risk is dominated by the upside potential.
In other words, the positive skewness of small stock returns along with the cumulative effects of compounding
at a higher rate increases both the available wealth for spending and ending wealth. Third, IRS’s RMDs are
taken into account for every withdrawal strategy examined. Lastly, it demonstrates that the simplest dynamic
strategy is superior to two popular dynamic strategies.

We use data from two representative U.S. household surveys, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
and the Health and Retirement Study (Rand\-HRS) to estimate Markov transition probability matrices between
health states over the lifecycle from age 20\-95\. We use non\-parametric and parametric methods and control
for individual characteristics such as age, gender, race, education, income as well as cohort effects. We align
two year transition probabilities from HRS with one year transition probabilities in MEPS using a stochastic
root method. We find that the non\-parametric counting method and the regression specifications based on
ordered logit models produce similar results over the lifecycle. However, the counting method overestimates
the probabilities of transitioning into bad health states. In addition, we find that young women have worse
health prospects than their male counterparts but once individuals get older, being female is associated with
transitioning into better health states with higher probabilities than men. We do not find significant differences
of the conditional health transition probabilities between African Americans and the rest of the population.
We also find that the lifecycle patterns are stable over time. Finally, we discuss issues with controlling for time
effects, sample attrition, and other modeling issues that can arise with categorical outcome variables.

Vanguard.
Choosingahealthinsuranceplaninvolvesacomplexanalysisofpremiums,deductibles,out\-of\-pocketmaximums,
and tax costs. The right choice depends on an individual’s policy options, budget, and expected health care
needs.The rapid growth of high\-deductible health plans (HDHPs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) adds
more complexity to the decision but also creates a unique opportunity to save for retirement and other long\-
term goals. We explore these underappreciated savings opportunities by reviewing the what, why, and how
of HSAs. 1\) The what HSAs are tax\-sheltered savings accounts available to those enrolled in a high\-deductible
health plan (HDHP). An HDHP charges lower premiums than traditional insurance plans but comes with higher
deductibles and out\-of\-pocket maximums. An HSA provides tax benefits to help defray these higher costs. 2\)
The why In tax\-advantaged accounts such as IRAs, 401(k) plans, and 529 college savings plans, you pay taxes
now or later. With an HSA, the ”now” or ”later” can become ”never.” These tax savings can compound to
produce higher returns than those available from other accounts 3\) The how The how depends on how much you
can afford to save. For those with enough savings capacity, the best strategy is to treat the HSA as a long\-term
investment account by paying for current medical expenses out of pocket. If you have less capacity to save, the
decision is more complex, involving both investment and behavioral considerations.
Kaplan, P. D. (2006\). “Asset Allocation with Annuities for Retirement Income Management .” In:The Journal of
Wealth Management 8(4\), pp. 27–40\.
The author starts with a statement of the problem: at, in, or near retirement, investors need to make specific
decisions about how they are going to use their savings to generate income during retirement and meet their
estate goals when they die. If they withdraw too much each year for spending needs, they face the risk of
running out of assets before they die. This is often called risk. If they withdraw too little, they may not be able
to meet their immediate expenses and support a certain lifestyle. Investors also need to decide how to invest
their savings among asset classes and annuities. The author explores retirement income solutions in a simple
setting to illustrate the trade\-offs that retired investors face regarding how much income they can generate, how
much short\-term risk they are exposed to, how large an estate they can expect to leave, and how likely they are
not to run out of assets before dying (the probability).

of low power. In particular, we make use of a novel pretest\-based portfolio strategy to show how the information
regarding performance tests can be used optimally.
Kazak,E.andPohlmeier,W.(2020\). Portfolio Pretesting with Machine Learning .Tech.rep.UniversityofLancaster.
This paper exploits the idea of pretesting to choose between competing portfolio strategies. We propose an
estimator for a portfolio weight vector, which optimally trades off between Type I and Type II errors when
choosing the best investment strategy. Furthermore we accommodate the idea of bagging in the portfolio testing
problems, which helps to avoid sharp thresholding and reduces the amount of portfolio turnover. Our approach
borrows from both shrinkage and forecast combination literature. The portfolio weights of our strategy are
weighted averages of the portfolio weights from a set of stand\-alone strategies. More specifically, the weights are
generated from a pseudo out\-of\-sample portfolio pretesting, such that they reflect the probability that a given
strategy will be overall best performing. Contrary to previous approaches, the shrinkage intensity is continuously
updated to incorporate the most recent information in the rolling window forecasting set\-up. We show that the
bagged pretest estimator performs exceptionally well, especially when combined with adaptive smoothing. The
98resulting strategy allows for a flexible and smooth switch between the underlying strategies and is shown to
outperform the corresponding stand\-alone strategies.
Kelly, D. P. and Roy, K. (2021\). Annuities: An essential slice of the retirement pie . Tech. rep. J.P. Morgan Asset
Management.
When it comes to retirement planning, the greatest investment tools investors can exploit are diversification
and annuitization. Annuities have become an essential slice of the retirement pie for Americans approaching
and living in retirement. As part of a retirement income solution, annuities also can be an ideal complement
to other portfolios. We believe they are very well positioned in today’s uncertain market environment. Unlike
other financial instruments, these contracts issued by insurance companies combine the features of investing and
insurance in a single solution.
They offer a range of flexible benefits, including:
1\)Lifetime income: Annuities offer a variety of guaranteed income options that can start immediately or at a
future date.
2\)Growth potential: The earlier your clients invest, the more opportunity they’ll have for long\-term growth
potential from a broad range of investment choices. Growth will vary depending on the performance of the
investment options you choose.
3\)Tax\-deferral: Taxes can have a big impact on long\-term investment returns – making the benefit of a
tax\-deferred variable annuity especially attractive for high net worth and affluent investors
4\)Legacy options: Many variable annuity contracts offer special riders (for a fee) to provide death benefit
protection for loved ones.
We believe annuities are very well positioned in today’s uncertain market environment.

on Sustainable Withdrawal Rates .” In:The Journal of Retirement 2(2\), pp. 81–98\.
This article explores estimates for a sustainable withdrawal rate (SWR) for a typical retiree and examines two
important factors that challenge sustainability: sequence of returns and volatility of returns. Using historical
analysis, the article explores the implications of sequence of returns risk and suggests strategies for countering
it, including annuitization and adaptive withdrawal strategies. The article also explores volatility risk, separated
as much as possible from sequence risk, and finds that the relationship between volatility, return, and SWR is
not linear. In fact, for a given horizon and degree of confidence, the relationship between the Sharp ratio and the
rate of return displays an inflection point, where the level of return required per unit of risk reaches a minimum.
Khang, K. and Clarke, A. S. (2020\). Safeguarding retirement in a bear market . Tech. rep. Vanguard.
What is the effect of ”sequence\-of\-return” risk\-the risk of receiving a concentrated series of particularly poor
returns\-on retirees who depend on a financial portfolio to generate income? We provide a quantitative answer to
this question by examining the cohorts that would have retired during or near six major U.S. bear markets since
1926\. Compared to otherwise similar investors retiring during the same periods, and assuming constant real\-
dollarwithdrawals,theunluckyoneswithapoorsequenceofreturnswere31%morelikelytooutlivetheirwealth,
had 11% lower retirement income streams,and left 37% smaller bequests. These adverse effects can be mitigated
with an adaptive withdrawal strategy. By countering a decline in portfolio value with an incremental decrease
in planned withdrawal amounts, even those bearing the worst sequence\-of\-return risk could have eliminated the
possibility of premature portfolio depletion and increased their bequests by 20%. These improvements would
have required a manageable reduction in retirement income on the order of a 5% decrease in the first five years
and effectively no change over the whole 35 years of retirement.

mutual fund return, equity, real estate and gold commodity. Further, the chi\-Square and crammer\-v statistics
has been used to interpreting the association between these factors. And it revealed that the investors do not
always behave rationally and their choice of investments is decided by their risk profile and other demographical
factors such as age, gender, income, wealth etc. This research is also useful for portfolio managers to construct
the right portfolio for the investors according to their needs and preferences.

We field a large online survey to study preferences and hypothetical product choices for phased withdrawal
accounts and compare their demand to the demand of annuities. We find that most individuals prefer phased
withdrawal accounts with dynamic withdrawal rates and equity\-based asset allocation. Additionally, when of\-
fered the opportunity to exchange the phased withdrawal account with an annuity, most individuals decline to
annuitize. Our results suggest that policymakers should consider offering combined solutions of phased with\-
drawals and annuities. Retirees who are averse to full annuitization could preserve some of their accumulated
wealth while also acquiring protection against longevity risk.

In this paper, we propose a goal\-based investment model that is suitable for personalized wealth management.
The model only requires a few intuitive inputs such as size of wealth, investment amount, and consumption goals
from individual investors. In particular, a priority level can be assigned to each consumption goal and the model
provides a holistic solution based on a sequential approach starting with the highest priority. This allows strict
prioritization by maximizing the probability of achieving higher priority goals that are not affected by goals
with lower priorities. Furthermore, the proposed model is formulated as a linear program that efficiently finds
the optimal financial plan. With its simplicity, flexibility, and computational efficiency, the proposed goal\-based

on your value: quantifying Vanguard Advisor’s Alpha . Tech. rep. Vanguard.
The value proposition of advice is changing. The nature of what investors expect from advisors is changing. And
fortunately, the resources available to advisors are evolving as well In creating the Vanguard Advisor’s Alpha
concept in 2001, we outlined how advisors could add value, or alpha, through relationship\-oriented services such
as providing cogent wealth management via financial planning, discipline, and guidance, rather than by trying
to outperform the market. Since then, our work in support of the concept has continued. This paper takes the
Advisor’s Alpha framework further by attempting to quantify the benefits that advisors can add relative to
others who are not using such strategies. Each of these can be used individually or in combination, depending
on the strategy. We believe implementing the Vanguard Advisor’s Alpha framework can add about 3% in net
returns for your clients and also allow you to differentiate your skills and practice. Like any approximation, the
actual amount of value added may vary significantly, depending on clients’ circumstances.
Kintzel, D. (2020\). “Income Sustainability in Retirement: A Case Study of the Life\-Cycle Account .” In:The Journal
of Retirement 7(3\), pp. 31–45\.
This article uses Monte Carlo analysis to simulate returns for a popular retirement portfolio strategy and the
income derived from it in retirement in order to calculate the chance of it being depleted while the retiree is
still alive. I analyze and contrast several withdrawal strategies from the account to illustrate the important
trade\-offs between income needs and account sustainability. Furthermore, the simulations are compared with
payouts from an annuity to show the important differences between each vehicle ability to provide income. The
primary findings are that portfolios have a higher chance of account instability with advanced age and income
needs, whereas annuities may provide less income earlier in retirement, but the income is sustainable for life.
Kitces, M. (2015\). “Sequence of return risk and safe withdrawal rates .” In:Retirement Income Conference .
Watching a portfolio experience market volatility in the first few years of retirement can be terrifying to a new
retiree, raising legitimate questions of whether there’s a danger that early declines plus ongoing withdrawals
could lead to a retirement spending shortfall. And as the safe withdrawal rate research has shown, that danger is
real \- in fact, it’s been dubbed the ”sequence of return” risk to retirement spending, a recognition of the reality
that even if returns average out in the long run, it doesn’t matter if ongoing withdrawals deplete the portfolio
before the ”good” returns finally show up. Yet the caveat is that while sequence of return risk is real, it’s not
necessarily just about the danger of getting a severe bear market on the eve of retirement. In fact, a deeper
look at the data reveals that there is remarkably little relationship between returns in the first year or two of
retirement, and the safe withdrawal rate that can be sustained in the portfolio, even if retirement starts out with
a market crash. Instead, it turns out that the true driver of sequence of return risk and safe withdrawal rates are
the returns that the retiree earns over the first decade \- and specifically, the real returns over the first decade,
that provide an indication of whether the retirement portfolio will have produced enough real growth to keep
up with inflation\-adjusted spending for the rest of retirement. Fortunately, though, bad decades of returns are
100not entirely random, and instead can be reasonably predicted by long\-term market valuation trends, providing
retirees with at least a few tools to manage the dangers of sequence of return risk through adjusting asset
allocation in retirement and setting a reasonable initial withdrawal rate in light of the market conditions that
exist \- and the potential for a bad decade of returns \- when their retirement begins.
Kitces, M. and Richards, C. (2019\). Kitces \& Carl Ep 01: How To Value The Value Of Financial Planning .
url:https://www.kitces.com/blog/kitces\-carl\-richards\-talk\-value\-of\-financial\-planning\-
intangible/ .
One of the biggest challenges comprehensive financial planners face today is that ”everyone” says they do
financial planning. Yet in practice, what they actually do, whether it’s really comprehensive financial planning,
or even what constitutes ”financial planning” as opposed to just ad hoc financial advice, has no clear and
consistent definition within the industry. And if we can’t figure out what the differences are within the industry,
then it’s almost impossible for the public to understand the differences between the services offered (including
any potential conflicts) by a whole bunch of people who do different stuff (frequently playing by different sets
of rules) yet say they all do the same thing! Not to mention trying to help the public understand the value
(both financially tangible and intangible) of the financial planning choices available and being offered to them.
Fortunately, both Morningstar, Vanguard, and Envestnet have done some research to try and quantify an answer
to this very question. Their studies suggest that, even when we ignore any potential excess investment return, the
advice that advisors provide around the dollars that they are managing can amount to an additional 1\.5\-3\.0%
over what a client would have likely gotten had they ”done it themselves” But, outside of ”helping clients avoid
big mistakes” by re\-allocating their portfolios or talking them off the proverbial ”ledge” when volatility ticks up,
there’s arguably another aspect to helping clients that transcends the ”quantifiable” aspect of the profession.
Because most clients don’t have anywhere else they can go and feel safe talking about this topic of money, that
is so important yet remains a taboo topic of discussion, and for many carries an enormous amount of baggage.
And those hurdles only expand geometrically when it’s a couple that’s sitting across the desk. In fact, perhaps
the greatest problem of trying to explain the value of financial advice, especially while the industry is in the
midst of such rapid change, is that we are still tying all our value conversations back to the portfolio\-based
model... to the extent that, even when trying to quantify the behavioral aspects of planning, industry studies
still scale them to a percentage of assets. Even though an increasingly amount of the value of financial planning
advice is specifically about the advice that occurs outside of the portfolio! Alternatively, perhaps instead of
trying to put a dollar value on the advice we provide as advisors at all, we might just consider framing it in
terms of the real\-world outcomes for clients. For instance, what if we as advisors simply said to a couple having
stressful arguments about money that, ”We help couples have better conversations about money, so they’re
not as awkward”? And then let them figure out if it’s valuable enough to them to pay for it? Because, if an
advisor can help reduce marital stress and reduce the number of marriages that end out in divorce because of
money issues, then clients might consider that a whole lot more valuable that we might have ever imagined
anyway! Ultimately, then, the key point is to recognize that as financial planning continues to expand beyond
just building and managing diversified asset allocated portfolios, the key task as an industry is to figure out how
we can frame that value beyond the context of ”investable assets”. Because if we want to better communicate
our value to prospects and clients, especially beyond the portfolio, we must first be willing to fully embrace and
acknowledge that value ourselves.
Kitces, M. E. and Pfau, W. D. (2014\). “Retirement Risk, Rising Equity Glidepaths, and Valuation\-Based Asset
Allocation .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
This research investigates two types of dynamic asset allocation strategies (predetermined equity glidepaths
and valuation\-based asset allocation) for retirees using U.S. historical data. We analyze fixed asset allocations,
traditional declining equity glidepaths, rising equity glidepaths, accelerated traditional and rising glidepaths,
valuation\-based allocations tethered around a fixed allocation, and glidepaths with valuation\-based overlays.
With U.S. historical data, it is difficult to beat a strategy which maintains a consistently high allocation to
stocks (especially as measured by terminal median wealth), to the extent that a retiree’s risk tolerance allows for
this, and subject to the caveat that high stock allocations cannot always be expected to do as well in the future.
However, when we consider retirements beginning in varying valuation environments (as defined by the level of
Robert Shiller’s cyclically\-adjusted price\-earnings ratio relative to its then\-current historical median), we find
the potential for different dynamic allocation strategies to help retirees sustain higher spending levels with lower
averagestockallocationsincertainsituations.Whenretirementsbegininovervaluedmarketenvironments(which
reflects the situation for new retirees today), an accelerated rising equity glidepath has shown much potential to

have the greatest impact. In other valuation environments, historical worst\-case scenario sustainable withdrawal
rates were highest with valuation\-based asset allocation strategies, which maintain a midrange average stock
allocation but adjust higher or lower when markets are deemed undervalued or overvalued, respectively.

Kobor, A. and Muralidhar, A. (2020\). “Targeting Retirement Security with a Dynamic Asset Allocation Strategy .”
In:Financial Analysts Journal 76(3\), pp. 38–55\.
The goal of investing for retirement is to secure a target level of income that maintains the individual’s prere\-
tirement lifestyle. Current ”safe harbor” glide\-path products shift investments from stocks to bonds on the basis
of the individual’s age. This approach is unlikely to secure a target retirement income because the glide path is
focused on the wrong goal. We tested a dynamic asset allocation strategy that takes no view of future market
performance and is based on a retirement income goal. We show how this dynamic strategy could dominate
standard portfolio choices. The article introduces a new way to think about intermediate retirement targets and
explores the implications of the dynamic asset allocation strategy for the level of savings required to achieve a
retirement goal.

The case in which there are limitations in the types of annuities that are available is also considered and the costs

We optimize the asset allocation, consumption and bequest decisions of a couple with an uncertain lifetime. The
asset menu consists of zero coupon bonds and pure endowments with different maturities, whole life annuities
and stocks. The pure endowments pay either fixed or variable benefits, and, similarly to the whole life annuities,
are contingent on either a single or a joint lifetime. We model the stock returns and the parameters for the term
structure with a vector autoregressive model, thus considering time\-varying investment opportunities. To find
the optimal solution we use a multi\-stage stochastic programming approach, which allows for including complex
surrender charges on pure endowments and annuities, as well as transaction costs on stocks and bonds. Our
findings indicate that despite high surrender charges, households should invest in a wide combination of life
contingent products with different maturities and underlying financial risk.

The paper investigates the importance of inflation\-linked annuities to individuals facing inflation risk. Given
the investment opportunities in nominal, real, and variable annuities, as well as cash and stocks, we investigate
the consumption and investment decisions under two different objective functions: (1\) maximization of the
expected CRRA utility function (2\) minimization of squared deviations from an inflation\-adjusted target. To
find the optimal decisions we apply a multi\-stage stochastic programming approach. Our findings indicate that
independently of the considered ob\- jective function and risk aversion, real annuities are a crucial asset in
every portfolio. In addition, without investing in real annuities, the retiree has to rebalance the portfolio more
frequently, and still obtains the lower and more volatile real consumption.

Retirement in the Presence of Heterogeneous Preferences .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
The global shift towards defined\-contribution pension schemes has been accompanied by asymmetric risks and
new responsibilities for households to plan and fund effectively their own retirement over the years. In this study,
expressing and combining preferences for consumption, investment, bequest, public pension entitlement and the
choice of reverse mortgage products, we develop several utility\-based life cycle models to facilitate the complex
decision\-making process that retired households are required to follow to optimize their retirement income. This
optimal policy is given in the form of either an analytical or a numerical solution using stochastic dynamic
programming. The timing of this paper coincides with the launch of a reverse mortgage style loan, offered by
the Australian federal government and allowing retired households to receive an income stream by taking out a
loan against the equity in their home. Calibration is performed using real Australian household data.

constraints .” In:Annals of Operations Research 260(1\-2\), pp. 255–291\.
An individual investor has to decide how to allocate his/her savings from a retirement perspective. This problem
covers a long\-term horizon. In this paper we consider a 40\-year horizon formulating a multi\-criteria multistage
program with stochastic dominance constraints in an intermediate stage and in the final stage. As we are
dealing with a real problem and we have formulated the model in cooperation with a commercial Italian bank,
the intermediate stage corresponds to a possible withdrawal allowed by the Italian pension system. The sources
of uncertainty considered are: the financial returns, the interest rate evolution, the investor’s salary process and a
considerable withdrawal event. We include a set of portfolio constraints according to the pension plan regulation.
The objective of the model is to minimize the Average Value at Risk Deviation measure and to satisfy wealth
goals. Three different wealth target formulations are considered: a deterministic wealth target (i.e. a comparison
between the accumulated average wealth and a fixed threshold) and two stochastic dominance relations\-the
first order and the second order\-introducing a benchmark portfolio and then requiring the optimal portfolio to
dominate the benchmark. In particular, we prove that solutions obtained under stochastic dominance constraints
ensure a safer allocation while still guaranteeing good returns. Moreover, we show how the withdrawal event
affects the solution in terms of allocation in each of the three frameworks. Finally, the sensitivity and convergence
of the stochastic solutions and computational issues are investigated.

This article provides a critique of the combined LDI/De\-risking Glide Path strategy as currently implemented
by many pension plan managers and also provides an example of an alternative solution that improves pension
plan outcomes. Our prescription for the pension de\-risking glide path approach differs from conventional wisdom,
resulting in faster de\-risking, without undesirable market betas that are unrelated to the liability. It also avoids
illiquid assets that pension funds often gravitate toward in their quest for returns, takes fewer credit risks, and
seeks more alpha risks.
Kritzman, M. (2017\). “Target\-Date Funds: A Regime\-Based Approach .” In:The Journal of Retirement 5(1\), pp. 96–
105\.
Target\-date funds automatically shift the asset mix at regular intervals toward safer assets as the fund’s target
date, which may be several decades away, draws near. A target\-date fund is designed to reduce exposure to loss
as the investor moves closer to retirement and has fewer years to offset potential losses. The implicit assumption
103of a target\-date fund is that exposure to loss from risky assets increases as time decreases; hence the shift to safer
assets as the investment horizon shrinks. However, another implicit assumption of target\-date funds is that the
standard deviation of assets is relatively stationary. The typical approach for determining the glide path assumes
implicitly that the asset’s annualized standard deviation will not change much during any subperiod within the
longer horizon. This second assumption is contrary to experience. Subperiod volatility is highly nonstationary,
although it is not entirely unpredictable. Investors would be better served by the strategy this author describes,
of not only managing the effect of time on exposure to loss but also accounting for the nonstationarity of risk.

University of Gottingen.
This dissertation addresses different key elements in portfolio management. It intends to improve and analyze
influences on portfolio strategies and their performance. Likewise, it aims at the systematization and extension of
benchmark specifications as well as their effect on portfolio strategies. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect
of developing and implementing portfolio strategies. The dissertation seeks to contribute to the advancement of
portfolio strategies by making the performance generating process and influences on it more comprehensible and
transparent. In doing so, it attempts to strengthen the awareness of the impact of the exact design of portfolio
strategies and benchmarks on the resulting portfolio and its performance. The key findings of this dissertation
can be summarized as follows: The benchmark specification, especially in terms of the investible universe and the
inherent risk conception, has substantial influence on the explicit design and performance of portfolio strategies.
In general, the specification of the benchmark and design of portfolio strategies should be carefully considered
and the implementation should be well thought out. Alternative risk conceptions, such as regret risk, can be
applied to portfolio selection and lead to clearly different portfolio compositions. Moreover, timing strategies can
be improved by choosing a careful investment approach on the basis of distributional regressions. All empirical
work 3 of this thesis has in common that it pursues different ideas to set up portfolio strategies while explicitly
addressing the benchmark specification used for the implementation and evaluation of said strategies.

While individuals who delay the receipt of social security benefits are entitled to larger monthly payments, 57%
of recipients elect to receive benefits early. This article compares the present value of social security benefits
when taken early to the present value of benefits taken at the full or maximum retirement ages, taking into
account factors such as average life expectancy and the time value of money. Furthermore, we expand on prior
research by investigating how tax rates may affect these comparisons. Overall, our analyses suggest that taking
social security early may be advantageous for many individuals.

We exploit a unique Swiss reform to identify the importance of passivity, claiming social security benefits at the
Full Retirement Age (FRA). Sharp discontinuities generated by the reform reveal that raising the FRA while
imposing small early claiming penalties significantly delays pension claiming and retirement, but imposing large
penalties and holding the FRA fixed does not. The nature of the reform allows us to identify that between 47
and 69% of individuals are passive, while imposing additional structure point identifies the fraction at 67%. An
original survey of Swiss pensioners reveals that reference\-dependent preferences is the main source of passivity.

The intent of this paper is to help financial advisers prepare for a client discussion about the required minimum

Clients who plan to follow this strategy need to be advised that the asset allocation they choose affects the

The high\-profile debate on spending in retirement often misses a crucial point: No single spending rate suits
all retirees. This article develops guidance on spending rates for retirees. Taking into account uncertain asset
returns, inflation, and longevity, the authors identify spending rates and asset allocations that minimize the
expected lifetime shortfall for a systematic withdrawal plan. The analysis shows that sustainable spending rates
depend critically on a client’s age, gender, and risk tolerance. It also demonstrates that retirees can reduce the
risk of outliving their wealth and increase their expected future bequest by allocating at least some of their
portfolios to equities. Moreover, the younger the retiree and the greater her spending needs, the more she should
allocate to equities. Finally, because their wealth must last longer, couples should allocate more to equities and
spend at a more moderate rate than those who are single.

Le Guenedal, T. and Roncalli, T. (2022\). Portfolio Construction with Climate Risk Measures . Tech. rep. Amundi
Asset Management.
Because of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the development of ESG investing and the emergence of net zero emission
policies, climate risk is certainly the most important topic and challenge for asset owners and managers now and
will remain so over the next five years. It considerably changes portfolio allocation and the investment framework
of both passive and active investors. The goal of this paper is to conduct a survey of the various climate risk
measures that are available in the asset management industry and the practices of portfolio construction that
use these metrics.
Therefore, the first part of this paper lists the different climate risk metrics \- e.g., carbon footprint, carbon
transition pathway, carbon transition and physical risks. The second part is dedicated to portfolio optimization,
in particular portfolio decarbonization and portfolio alignment (Paris\-based benchmarks and net zero carbon
objective). Among the different findings, two are of great importance for investors. First, portfolio decarboniza\-
tion is more difficult when we include scope 3 carbon emissions. Indeed, optimizing using the sum of scopes 1, 2
and 3 emissions leads to a portfolio with more tracking error risk than using direct plus first tier indirect carbon
emissions. Second, portfolio alignment is more complex than portfolio decarbonization. Since aligning portfo\-
lios with scope 3 is becoming the standard approach to climate portfolio construction, the impact on portfolio
management may be substantial, and the divergence between carbon investing and traditional investing will
increase.

Term Financial Projections .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Presenting the results of long\-term financial projections, particularly those of common interest in retirement
planning such as portfolio value and retirement income, can be difficult using traditional risk measures . Long\-
term projected distributions tend to be very wide and offer limited insight to practitioners into what kind of
adjustments might be required along the way to avoid undesirable outcomes. Short\-term projections, where
available, lack information about final, long\-term outcomes. As a complement to the pure long\-term and short\-
term risk measures associated with these distributions, we propose a third measure, expectation risk, which
reflects the short\-term risk in long\-term outcomes. This measure is derived from the short\-term distribution of
long\-term expectations. In the following, we demonstrate how to calculate these distributions for simple cases
of portfolio value and retirement income. Further, we show how expectation risk can be used to estimate the
magnitude of short\-term adjustments that may be required to obtain a desired long\-term income.

approximation captures how annual fees can compound over a decade or more to cumulative costs an order of
magnitude higher. The formula is simple enough for rapid hand calculation.

The authors first observe that both the widespread popularity of saving in tax\-deferred retirement vehicles
such as IRAs, Keogh plans, and 401(k) programs and the magnitude of the dollar flows into such saving are
almost prima facie evidence that at the margin they provide significant gains over saving in traditional taxable
accounts, at least for those wanting to defer some part of lifetime consumption to their retirement years. They
focus on the gains arising solely from shifting taxable income from the working (i.e., accumulation) years to the
retirement (i.e., distribution) years. They turn to the advantages of tax\-deferred investing and to the motivation
for focusing on the intertemporal shifting of taxable income. Finally, they propose an informal model of the gains
from such income shifting and illustrate the magnitude of the gains for levels of annual wage income ranging
from 50,000 to 200,000\. They show that the gain (as measured by the difference in after\-tax retirement income
from tax\-deferred and taxable accounts) increases with wage income and ranges from 1\.7 percent to 11\.4 percent.

In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 99, pp. 152–162\.
This paper investigates mortality inequality across U.S. states by modeling and forecasting mortality rates
via a forecast reconciliation approach. Understanding the heterogeneity in state\-level mortality experience is
of fundamental importance, as it can assist decision making for policymakers, health authorities, as well as
local communities who are seeking to reduce inequalities and disparities in life expectancy. A key challenge of
multi\-population mortality modeling is high dimensionality, and the resulting complex dependence structures
across sub\-populations. Moreover, when projecting future mortality rates, it is important to ensure that the
state\-level forecasts are coherent with the national\-level forecasts. We address these issues by first obtaining
independent state\-level forecasts based on classical stochastic mortality models, and then incorporating the
106dependence structure in the forecast reconciliation process. Both traditional bottom\-up reconciliation and the
cutting\-edge trace minimization reconciliation methods are considered. Based on the U.S. total mortality data
for the period 1969\-2017, we project the 10\-year\-ahead mortality rates at both national\-level and state\-level up
to 2027\. We find that the geographical inequality in the longevity levels is likely to continue in the future, and
the mortality improvement rates will tend to slow down in the coming decades.

proposed model utilizes a data\-driven method to determine the autoregressive coefficient matrix, and then em\-
ploys a rotation algorithm in the projection phase to generate age\-coherent mortality forecasts. In the estimation
phase, the age\-specific mortality improvement rates are fitted to a VAR model with dimension reduction algo\-
rithms such as the elastic net. In the projection phase, the projected mortality improvement rates are assumed
to follow a short\-term fluctuation component and a long\-term force of decay, and will eventually converge to an
age\-invariant mean in expectation. The age\-invariance of the long\-term mean guarantees age\-coherent mortality
projections. The proposed model is generalized to multi\-population context in a computationally efficient man\-
ner. Using single\-age, uni\-sex mortality data of the UK and France, we show that the proposed model is able
to generate more reasonable long\-term projections, as well as more accurate short\-term out\-of\-sample forecasts
than popular existing mortality models under various settings. Therefore, the proposed model is expected to be
an appealing alternative to existing mortality models in insurance and demographic analyses.
Li, Y. and Forsyth, P. A. (2019\). “A data\-driven neural network approach to optimal asset allocation for target
based defined contribution pension plans .” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 86, pp. 189–204\.
A data\-driven Neural Network (NN) optimization framework is proposed to determine optimal asset allocation
during the accumulation phase of a defined contribution pension scheme. In contrast to parametric model
based solutions computed by a partial differential equation approach, the proposed computational framework
can scale to high dimensional multi\-asset problems. More importantly, the proposed approach can determine
the optimal NN control directly from market returns, without assuming a particular parametric model for the
return process. We validate the proposed NN learning solution by comparing the NN control to the optimal
control determined by solution of the Hamilton\-Jacobi\-Bellman (HJB) equation. The HJB equation solution is
based on a double exponential jump model calibrated to the historical market data. The NN control achieves
nearly optimal performance. An alternative data\-driven approach (without the need of a parametric model) is
based on using the historic bootstrap resampling data sets. Robustness is checked by training with a blocksize
different from the test data. In both two and three asset cases, we compare performance of the NN controls
directly learned from the market return sample paths and demonstrate that they always significantly outperform
constant proportion strategies.

e\-Print.
A common view of retail finance is that conflicts of interest contribute to the high cost of advice. Within a
large sample of Canadian financial advisors and their clients, however, we show that advisors typically invest
personally just as they advise their clients. Advisors trade frequently, chase returns, prefer expensive, actively
managed funds, and underdiversify. Advisors’ net returns of \-3% per year are similar to their clients’ net returns.
Advisors do not strategically hold expensive portfolios only to convince clients to do the same; they continue to
do so after they leave the industry.
Lobel, H., Jaconetti, C. M., and Cuff, R. (2019\). The replacement ratio: Making it personal . Tech. rep. Vanguard.
A replacement ratio is a rule of thumb that estimates what percentage of a person’s pre\-retirement income will
be needed to maintain their lifestyle at retirement. Most studies suggest aiming for a target of between 70 and
85 percent of pre\-retirement income. Knowing which end of that range would be more appropriate, however,
is an important step in developing a retirement plan. With our approach to calculating the replacement ratio,
investors begin with their current annual consumption and then factor in the changes in taxes and health\-
care costs. The replacement ratio is that total amount expressed as a percentage of the investor’s pre\-retirement
income. Because people\-and thus their retirement goals\-are unique, otherwise\-similar investors can have different
replacement ratios. Variables affecting the desired ratio include broad demographic differences (marital status
and income level, for example) as well as more subtle, personalized influences (homeownership, health status,
the type of accounts dedicated for retirement, for example).

107in Multi\-asset Multi\-factor Allocations .” In:Machine Learning for Asset Management: New Developments and
Financial Applications . Ed. by E. Jurczenko. Wiley, pp. 329–368\.
This chapter examines the use and merits of hierarchical clustering techniques in the context of multi\-asset
multi\-factor investing. In particular, it contrasts these techniques with several competing risk\-based allocation
paradigms, such as 1/N, minimum\-variance, standard risk parity and diversified risk parity. The chapter intro\-
duces hierarchical risk parity (HRP) strategies based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and also introduces
hierarchical clustering based on the lower tail dependence coefficient. The chapter provides an overview of tradi\-
tional risk\-based allocation strategies and outlines a framework to measure and manage portfolio diversification.
It examines the performance of the introduced HRP strategies relative to the traditional alternatives. The chap\-
ter discusses Meucci’s approach to managing diversification, which serves to construct a diversified risk parity
strategy based on economic factors.

This paper studies how hyperbolic discounting affects stock market participation, asset allocation, and saving
decisions over the life cycle in an economy with Epstein Zin preferences. Hyperbolic discounting affects saving
and portfolio decisions through at least two channels: (1\) it lowers desired saving, which decreases financial
wealth relative to future earnings; and (2\) it lowers the incentive to pay a fixed cost to enter the stock market.
Wefindthathyperbolicdiscountersaccumulatelesswealthrelativetotheirgeometriccounterpartsandthatthey
participate in the stock market at a later age. Because they have lower levels of financial wealth relative to future
earnings, hyperbolic discounters who do participate in the stock market tend to hold a higher share of equities,
particularly in the retirement years. We find that increasing the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, holding
risk aversion constant, greatly magnifies the impact of hyperbolic discounting on all of the model’s decision
rules and simulated levels of participation, allocation, and wealth. Finally, we introduce endogenous financial
knowledge accumulation and find that hyperbolic discounting leads to lower financial literacy and inefficient
stock market investment.

Lumby, J. (2017\). “Three Essays on Managing Risk in Retirement .” PhD thesis. Texas Tech University.
Individuals face a number of risks when entering retirement, such as unknown life expectancy, variable medical
expenses, and uncertain financial market returns. Understanding these risks in advance will allow retirees to
pursue appropriate risk management strategies to reduce the likelihood of experiencing negative events that
could jeopardize the retirement period. Unfortunately, many retirees either do not understand the risks that
they face, or are ill\-prepared to handle these risks when they inevitably arise. In this dissertation, I provide
new insights into the dynamic relationship between consumer knowledge, risk exposure, and insurance coverage.
The first essay provides evidence that many elderly individuals do not understand the risks associated with
unknown late\-in\-life medical expenses, such as nursing care. When educated, many retirees indicate an increased
willingness to purchase a suitable insurance policy as a hedge against the risk. The second essay finds that a
small percentage of retirees are insured against multiple retirement risks, and that this behavior is associated
with increased financial wealth and successful retirement outcomes. Although insurance can provide a hedge
against a multitude of financial risks, the third essay suggests that life satisfaction in retirement is about more
than material wealth.

consider risk tolerance as it relates to their financial situation. Fuzzy\-trace theory, a psycholinguistic theory of
risk processing rooted in prospect theory that is becoming increasingly popular in the medical field, guided the
study. Quantitative results indicate that stated versus revealed measures of risk tolerance are not consistent for
most people. However, higher risk literacy increases the likelihood of consistency. Qualitative results reveal that
individuals perceive risk tolerance through various lenses, including knowledge, values, emotions, and personal
experience.
Lussier, J. (2019\). “Secure retirement: connecting financial theory and human behavior .” In:CFA Institute Research
Foundation .
Investors fear return uncertainty and drawdowns associated with owning relatively risky asset classes, such as
equity. The fact that greater risk is associated with greater expected return does not preclude the possibility
that realized returns may be far less than a low\-risk asset could provide, even with horizons as long as 5 to 10
years. Fear prompts the average investor to sometimes act against his own best interest. Therefore, the average
investor portfolio often underperforms a static benchmark, even before fees. The average investor tends to
increase allocation to riskier assets after the market has already significantly risen and decrease allocation after
a significant decline.Given that financial planning in the context of retirement is a multidecade endeavor that
109can last 50 years or more, investors face an additional challenge. Financial planners cannot be concerned solely
with the behavior of investors facing short\-term return uncertainty, which remains an important challenge,
but must also be concerned with how to address longer\-term uncertainties. For example, there is significant
uncertainty about the assumption for long\-term expected returns, real as well as nominal. Some lucky investors
may accumulate much of their wealth before retirement during an exceptionally strong bull market (e.g., 1982
to 2000\), whereas less fortunate investors may have been planning to retire in 2008 or early 2009, just after
the most dramatic global liquidity crisis since the Great Depression and a significant decline in interest rates.
Moreover, average expected returns represent only part of the story. Some investors may have recorded above\-
average returns at a time when their accumulated wealth was already significant, whereas others may have
recorded above\-average returns when their accumulated wealth was low. The implication of the interactions
among savings patterns (in accumulation), withdrawal patterns (in decumulation), and timing of above\- and
below\-average portfolio returns is important to understand, particularly with respect to how the interactions
should affect the allocation policy.Furthermore, investors face significant risks in the transition period \- say,
the last 5 to 10 years \- from accumulation to decumulation. Considering the uncertainty in long\-term expected
returns, patterns of returns, and patterns of savings, it is unlikely that a financial plan established when an
individual is 30 years old can remain static thereafter. The plan must be revaluated periodically, which requires
an effective feedback mechanism or tool. The investor has many more options available before retirement,
however, although some may not necessarily be pleasant. In the event of lower than expected accumulated
wealth, the investor could decide to save more, postpone retirement, and/or adjust retirement plans. These
options may be unavailable or may be harder to implement once the decision to retire has been made. The
investor must implement a transition strategy that reduces the likelihood and/or significance of the unplanned
adjustments that may be necessary as the targeted or desired retirement date draws near.In addition, longevity
remains uncertain, and retirement plans often are based on expected longevity. Even though the median life
expectancy for a 65\-year\-old individual in the United States is 83\.3 years for men and 85\.9 years for women, a
significant percentage of people will live past age 90\. Furthermore, as someone ages, the older she is expected to
live. A dynamic issue, life expectancy becomes even more complicated in the context of a couple \- one or both
individuals could live a very long time. This possibility should also influence the allocation policy over time and
the potential need for longevity insurance.Finally, governments in many countries have implemented policies and
programs to support the retirement effort. The most important program in the United States is Social Security,
but its purpose is to provide only a minimum level of inflation\-adjusted income, not to sustain the standard of
living that an individual had before retirement. Other programs seek to encourage savings and facilitate wealth
accumulation, such as 401(k)s, traditional and Roth IRAs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans and Tax\-Free
Savings Accounts in Canada), and health savings accounts (HSAs). Most investors, however, underestimate the
savings effort required to maintain the standard of living to which they are accustomed, cannot implement a
comprehensive and coherent adaptive retirement plan, cannot optimize across all relevant parameters, and lack
access to the feedback mechanism needed to make the appropriate adjustments over time.

Literature Review on Drawing Down Retirement Financial Savings .” In:North American Actuarial Journal
17(3\), pp. 181–215\.
How do, could, and should retirees draw down their financial savings? This article reviews over 100 papers on
this topic from the perspective of individuals, families, governments, and financial institutions.
Three significant conceptual/methodological weaknesses in the existing literature are identified:
1\)analysts have examined a limited range of self\-managed drawdown strategies;
2\)nearly all have ignored home ownership, pensions, debt, and government taxes and transfers when quanti\-
tatively evaluating alternative drawdown strategies;
3\)there is a well\-acknowledged gap between the behavior implied by economic models and that of real\-life
individuals, particularly when it comes to voluntary annuitization.
Expanding the set of drawdown strategies evaluated (e.g., including larger payouts when life expectancy is
reduced after the onset of a significant health condition, or using savings as bridge income to delay the take\-
up of Social Security payments), refining the income concept used, and more exact modeling of the trade\-offs
underlying individual decision\-making will likely increase the appeal of self\-managed drawdown strategies and
help resolve the ”annuity puzzle” that has long dominated this line of research. It may also lead to advice and
financial products that will better meet the needs of retirees.

Pensions, Taxes and Government Transfers Matter Much for Optimal Decisions? ” In:ASTIN Bulletin 48(3\),
pp. 1277–1306\.
This paper examines the importance of pensions (employment and social security), taxes and government trans\-
fers for alternative retirement savings drawdown strategies (DS), compared to the conventional approach in
published literature of using a gross income concept obtainable from retirement savings alone. Using a lifetime
utility framework, our longitudinal dynamic micro\-simulation model incorporates risk aversion, stochastic mar\-
kets, stochastic mortality and the interactions among sources of retirement income within the complex Canadian
tax and social benefit system, enabling us to rank commonly advocated DS and to ask whether incorporating
pensions, taxes and transfers alters those rankings. Our findings show the importance of treating the evaluation
of alternative DS as a comprehensive and integrated problem by including all sources of income \- including
pensions, taxes and government transfers. Using restricted income measures can potentially lead to simplistic,
and possibly misleading, conclusions.

Making under Uncertainty . Ed. by G. Consigli, D. Kuhn, and P. Brandimarte. Vol. 245\. Springer International
Publishing, pp. 35–53\.
Security prices changes are known to have a non\-normal distribution, with heavy tails. There are modifications
to the standard geometric Brownian motion model which accomodate heavy tails, most notably (1\) adding point
processes to the Brownian motion or (2\) classifying time into regimes. With regimes the prices follow Brownian
motion dynamics within regime, but the parameters vary by regime. The unconditional distribution of returns
is a mixture of normals, with the mixing coefficients being Markov transition probabilities. The contrasting
approaches have a common link\-risk factors. In the case of the point processes, the intensity of ”shocks” depends
on a set of factors, eg. bond\-stock yield differential, credit spread, implied volatility, exchange rates. The factors
drive shocks, which are a component of the returns. With regimes, the economic state is hidden (latent) and
is determined by the period by period observations on factors. The characterization of regimes follows from
description in terms of the set of risk factors. In this paper the link between the shocks and regimes is explored.
The shocks times defined by risk factors are an alternative method of determining regimes and the classifications
by shocks and by the Expectation\-Maximization algorithm are examined. The connections factors \-\> regimes
\-\> shocks further justifies a classification of financial markets into homogeneous epochs. The regime structure
leads to improved estimates for distribution parameters. The methods are applied to the prediction of returns on
Sector Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).The allocation of investment capital to funds based on predicted returns
generates favorable wealth accumulation over a planning horizon.
Maclean,Ziemba,W.T.,andLi, Y.(2005\). “Timetowealthgoalsincapitalaccumulation .”In:Quantitative Finance
5(4\), pp. 343–355\.
This paper considers the problem of investment of capital in risky assets in a dynamic capital market in con\-
tinuous time. The model controls risk, and in particular the risk associated with errors in the estimation of
asset returns. The framework for investment risk is a geometric Brownian motion model for asset prices, with
random rates of return. The information filtration process and the capital allocation decisions are considered
separately. The filtration is based on a Bayesian model for asset prices, and an (empirical) Bayes estimator
for current price dynamics is developed from the price history. Given the conditional price dynamics, investors
allocate wealth to achieve their financial goals efficiently over time. The price updating and wealth reallocations
occur when control limits on the wealth process are attained. A Bayesian fractional Kelly strategy is optimal
at each rebalancing, assuming that the risky assets are jointly lognormal distributed. The strategy minimizes
the expected time to the upper wealth limit while maintaining a high probability of reaching that goal before
falling to a lower wealth limit. The fractional Kelly strategy is a blend of the log\-optimal portfolio and cash and
is equivalently represented by a negative power utility function, under the multivariate lognormal distribution
assumption. By rebalancing when control limits are reached, the wealth goals approach provides greater control
over downside risk and upside growth. The wealth goals approach with random rebalancing times is compared
to the expected utility approach with fixed rebalancing times in an asset allocation problem involving stocks,
bonds, and cash.

efficiency .” In:European Journal of Operational Research 290(3\), pp. 1192–1206\.
In this paper, we compare two of the main paradigms of portfolio theory: mean variance analysis and expected
utility. In particular, we show empirically that mean variance efficient portfolios are typically sub\-optimal for
non satiable and risk averse investors. We illustrate that the second order stochastic dominance (SSD) efficient
set is the solution of a multi\-objective optimization problem. We further show that the market portfolio is not
necessarily a solution to this optimization problem. We also conduct an empirical analysis, examining the ex
ante and ex post performance of SSD and mean variance efficient portfolios, using a bootstrap approach. In an
ex ante analysis, we compare empirical moments, the level of diversification and set distances of mean variance
and SSD efficient sets. We also show that the global minimum variance (GMV) portfolio and the part of the
mean variance efficient frontier (MVEF) composed of highly diversified portfolios is second order stochastically
dominated. This result also provides a possible alternative explanation for the diversification puzzle. Conducting
an ex post analysis, we construct second order stochastic dominating strategies that outperform the GMV
portfolio in terms of wealth and various other performance measures, producing a positive ex post opportunity
cost.
Malhotra, M. (2012\). “A Framework for Finding an Appropriate Retirement Income Strategy .” In:Journal of
Financial Planning .
Even though retirement distribution is the most actively researched area in the world of financial planning, the
profession still lacks a comprehensive analysis framework for comparing retirement distribution strategies. Such
a framework should do an apples\-to\-apples comparison among various retirement distribution strategies such as
the appropriate time to claim Social Security or the use of systematic portfolio withdrawals in combination with
fixed annuities, variable annuities, and bond ladders. The proposed framework in this paper includes two reward
and three risk metrics. The widely used metric of probability of success is complemented with two additional
risk metrics: a view into what happens when the plan fails and the amount of income generated from fixed
sources of cash flow. The proposed reward metrics are retirement income and average legacy. A general outline
of the effect of various income strategies on the metrics is provided, which can help planners practice the art of
building an income plan mixing a systematic withdrawal portfolio with a fixed source of cash flow such that the
plan provides acceptable confidence and reasonable protection in unfavorable markets with a potential to leave
a legacy (if so desired) in favorable markets.
Mantilla\-Garcia, D., Martinez\-Carrasco, M., Garcia Huitron, M. E., and Muralidhar, A. (2020\). “From Defined\-
Contribution Towards Target\-Income Retirement Systems .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
The current trend towards Defined Contribution (DC) retirement systems around the world has rendered the
risk management of pension funds crucial for the financial health of millions of people. Severe market downturns
have put in evidence the need for more effective practices to control losses of retirement income for pension
funds’ investors. Although the move from the static allocation of policy portfolios toward target\-date funds
(TDFs) encouraged by regulators features significant improvements, the latter strategies completely ignore the
variations in the cost of financing future consumption, which lessens the strategies’ ability to control losses in
retirement income. While optimal long\-term portfolio selection literature emphasizes the importance of hedging
against changes in the discount rates that determine the cost of financing future consumption, TDFs strategies,
regulatory incentives, and reporting to pension funds’ investors disregard the variations in long\-term discount
112rates by focusing in absolute returns. We address these shortcomings by (i) developing performance metrics,
such as DC funding\-ratios, that foster appropriate incentives for pension fund managers and more sensible and
simple reporting to their investors, (ii) introducing a series of asset allocation rules designed to secure a minimum
level of target\-income in retirement regardless of the returns of the risky assets in the portfolio. The strategies
are consistent with insights from long\-term portfolio theory and have the critical advantage of being free of any
model or parameter estimation risks. We illustrate its advantages relative to a standard TDF strategy in terms
of retirement security.

We study the dynamic consumption\-portfolio problem over the life cycle, with respect to tax\-deferred investing
for investors who acquire housing services by either renting or owning a home. The joint existence of these
two investment vehicles creates potential for tax arbitrage. Specifically, investors can deduct mortgage interest
payments from taxable income, while simultaneously earning interest in tax\-deferred accounts tax\-free. Matching
empirical evidence, our model predicts that investors with higher retirement savings choose higher loan\-to\-value
ratios to exploit this tax arbitrage opportunity. However, many households could benefit from more effectively
taking advantage of tax arbitrage.

Interest Rates .” In:Bankers, Markets and Investors (142\), pp. 4–17\.
This paper investigates whether the option to delay annuitization in times of low interest rates has value for
retirees. The retiree who chooses to wait bets on a fall in the annuity price brought about by a rise in the
interest rates; the cost of such a bet is the loss of the mortality credit during the waiting period. We show that
an investor who can only invest in bonds during the waiting period will never find waiting ex\-ante profitable if
annuities are fairly priced, because waiting is costly and buying a fairly priced annuity is a zero\-npv project.
In contrast, an investor allowed to invest part of her wealth in the stock market will be able to attain more
consumption on average, but at the cost of a sharp increase in risk. A retiree may choose to wait, however, if
she believes her views are not priced in the term structure. For such a retiree, waiting is optimal if the expected
increase in the interest rate is larger than the square of the hazard rate.
Martel, R. and Sharon, A. (2019a). An Untimely Retirement: The Dangers of ’Sequence Risk’ for Retirees – Intro\-
ducing ”Income to Outcome” retirement framework . Tech. rep. PIMCO.
A major market downturn at the beginning of one’s retirement journey is among the most potentially destructive
scenarios investors face. Sharp declines can lead to de\-risking and withdrawals from portfolios – both of which
tend to crystallize losses and make recovery harder or even impossible.
Fortunately, investors are not completely at the mercy of the markets when it comes to sequence risk and
retirement.
By setting up two dedicated portfolios – one, a bond portfolio designed to deliver necessary income in future
years ( ”paycheck replacement”), the other composed of higher\-risk long\-term growth\-oriented assets such as
equities – retirees may more easily avoid costly, knee\-jerk reactions that could undermine long\-term growth.
This is the essence of PIMCO’s ”Income to Outcome” retirement framework. It’s an approach that addresses
both the hard issues of asset allocation and the softer, but no less significant, challenges of behavioral finance.
Martel, R. and Sharon, A. (2019b). Financial Advisors and Retirement: The Decumulation Dilemma . Tech. rep.
PIMCO.
The retirement of the baby boomer generation represents a secular money\-in\-motion opportunity for financial
advisors \- one which may transform the asset management industry and individual advisory practices. But the
withdrawal of assets over an uncertain remaining lifetime – decumulation – remains both the solution most in
demand and the problem the industry has been least able to solve.
Our Income to Outcome decumulation framework incorporates behavioral insights that have become central to
how the industry understands investor decisions.
It seeks to help investors set and automate regular withdrawals, protect against sequence\-of\-returns risk, embed
better advice around optimal strategies for claiming Social Security, address longevity risk and pursue long\-term
growth in an endowment\-like portfolio to support unknown expenditures and maximize potential for bequests.
Martellini, L. and Milhau, V. (2020\). Advances in Retirement Investing . Cambridge University Press. 167 pp.
To supplement replacement income provided by Social Security and employer\-sponsored pension plans, indi\-
viduals need to rely on their own saving and investment choices during accumulation. Once retired, they must
also decide at which rate to spend their savings, with the usual dilemma between present and future consump\-
113tion in mind. This Element explains how financial engineering and risk management techniques can help them
in these complex decisions. First, it introduces ’retirement bonds’, or retirement bond replicating portfolios,
that provide stable and predictable replacement income during the decumulation period. Second, it describes
investment strategies that combine the retirement bond with an efficient performance\-seeking portfolio so as to
reduce uncertainty over the future amount of income while offering upside potential. Finally, strategies using risk
insurance techniques are proposed to secure minimum levels of replacement income while giving the possibility
of reaching higher levels of income.

Pension Crisis? ” In:The Journal of Portfolio Management 45(5\), pp. 136–151\.
Individuals preparing for retirement are currently left with an unsatisfactory choice between security with no
flexibility with annuity products and flexibility without security with investment products such as balanced
funds or target date funds. To get out of this impasse, the authors introduce a range of flexicure retirement
goal\-based investing strategies that offer both security and flexibility with respect to the objective of generating
replacement income in decumulation. Recent advances in financial engineering and digital technologies make
it possible to apply goal\-based investing principles to a much broader population of investors than the few
traditional clients who can afford customized mandates or private banking services, which suggests that these
flexicure retirement solutions can be used as part of the solution to the global pension crisis.

Social Security Benefits .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
When to claim Social Security retirement benefits is one of the most important financial decisions many people
make. The Social Security Administration (SSA) provides a variety of online tools and publications to help
individuals decide on their own when to claim benefits, but maintains a neutral stance on when a person should
claim. Because SSA remains neutral, other government, nonprofit, academic, and for\-profit entities have devel\-
oped tools to assist the public with their claiming decision. This note analyzes the advantages and limitations
of six online benefit calculators. Users of these online tools should consider the source of their information and
understand that the benefit estimates they produce are based on different underlying assumptions, which can
result in different estimated benefit amounts.
Marwood, D. and Minnen, D. (2020\). “Safely Boosting Retirement Income by Harmonizing Drawdown Paths .” In:
Journal of Financial Planning 33(11\), pp. 46–60\.
Building on Bengen’s famous 4 percent rule (Bengen 1994\), this paper introduces the DMSWR, a technique for
calculating withdrawal rates and retirement income levels that are safe, steady, and adjusted for inflation.
The DMSWR (named after the authors’ initials, plus the acronym for safe withdrawal rate) addresses two com\-
monly cited shortcomings of the 4 percent rule. First, it addresses the starting point paradox (Kitces 2008\) by
ensuring that initial retirement incomes are stable regardless of the precise retirement date and short\-term fluc\-
tuations in the stock market. Second, the DMSWR significantly reduces the risk of unnecessarily low retirement
income that leads to large, unspent portfolios at the end retirement.
The DMSWR provides withdrawal rates that are often substantially higher, and never lower, than the 4 percent
rule, which allows financial planners to recommend higher retirement incomes that are still safe.
The core insight underpinning the DMSWR is that a retiree can safely follow the ”drawdown path” of an earlier
retiree who follows the 4 percent rule and planned for a longer retirement. Since the earlier retiree’s withdrawals
are safe, the withdrawals of the new retiree must also be safe.
The DMSWR is safe in the same way the 4 percent rule is safe: the withdrawal rates have never failed in the
past and, were DMSWR to fail in the future, the 4 percent rule would also fail. Unlike many similar efforts to
boost safe withdrawal rates, the DMSWR does not include additional parameters or heuristics that might fail
114at a time when following the 4 percent rule would succeed.
Historically, the mean DMSWR for 30\-year retirements was 5\.48 percent, the highest DMSWR was 13\.3 percent,
and the DMSWR exceeded the baseline withdrawal rate by more than 100 basis points over 55 percent of the
time.
”Re\-retirement” using the DMSWR often allows incomes to increase during retirement. These higher incomes
succeed whenever the 4 percent rule succeeds. The software implementation is at github.com/minnend/dmswr .

The Unintended Consequences of Investing for the Long Run .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
We study how managers of funds created to invest for the long run behave when shielded from liquidity con\-
straints and their investors’ short\-term needs. Using the universe of US target\-date funds (TDFs), we document
that asset managers exploit lower investor attention to deliver lower performance. This results in a hypothetical
cumulative return loss of 21% for the average investor holding the fund for 50 years. This underperformance is
driven by fund families using the TDFs to smoothen the flow shocks of the affiliated open\-ended funds. It is also
due to higher fees arising from investing in the affiliated expensive share classes. We use the Pension Protection
Act of 2006 as an exogenous shock that made TDFs the default investment options within 401(k) retirement
plans.
McLean, R. (2021\). “Rebalancing Frequency and Safe Withdrawal Rates .” In:Advisor Perspectives .
Safe\-withdrawal rate (SWR) research has traditionally assumed annual portfolio rebalancing, and this is the
frequency suggested by many advisors (although some suggest quarterly, monthly, or even daily rebalancing!).
But is such frequent fiddling necessary? Rebalancing generates costs in fees and commissions and, depending on
the type of account, will trigger tax liabilities. I used the ”Big Picture” client education software to examine the
impact of rebalancing frequency on historical SWRs and other retirement outcomes. The results argue against
the notion to rebalance often.
McQuarrie, E. F. (2022a). “When and for Whom are Roth Conversions Most Beneficial? A New Set of Guidelines,
Cautions and Caveats .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Much has changed since penalty\-free Roth conversions were inaugurated in 2010\. Tax rates have gone up and
down. The re\-characterization provision went away. Heirs can no longer stretch out inherited Roth accounts over
a lifetime. Medicare surcharges were expanded and began to adjust for inflation. The age to begin Required
Minimum Distributions was pushed out to age 72 and the IRS changed the RMD divisor tables to further slow
the pace of distribution.
Given these developments it seemed worthwhile to re\-examine the rationale for Roth conversions. That effort
exposed multiple flaws in conventional wisdom:
1\)Future tax rates need not be higher for a conversion to pay off;
2\)Nor is it all that helpful to pay the tax on conversion from outside funds;
3\)Nor are Roth conversions especially beneficial for top bracket taxpayers as compared to middle class tax\-
payers;
4\)Rather, the greatest benefit accrues to taxpayers who can make the conversion partly in the zero percent
tax bracket, i.e., during a year with no other taxable income.
While the benefits from a Roth conversion are often small and slow to arrive, a Roth conversion will almost
always pay off if given enough time, i.e., for life spans that extend past 90 and so long as annual distributions
from converted amounts are not taken. Roth conversions work because of compounding, which requires the
conversion to be left undisturbed for a long time. The paper elucidates the role played by the mathematics of
compounding in underwriting the success of Roth conversions.
McQuarrie, E. F. (2022b). “Will Required Minimum Distributions Exhaust My Savings and Leave Me in Penury? ”
In:SSRN e\-Print .
This paper probes the question of how long retirement savings can be sustained under mandated withdrawals
whose rate increases with age. It begins with idealized, constant rates of return typical of balanced funds. These
laboratory analyses show that funds are unlikely to be exhausted before age 100, and that exhaustion, when it
comes, occurs because of Bengen’s test, i.e., the eventual need to withdraw more than the minimum to maintain
the initial age 72 income in constant dollars. Next, the paper examines sequence\-of\-returns risk using selected
historical data. The worst decade for balanced fund returns in the US was located, but even with this bad start
the crudest sort of balanced portfolio could still be made to sustain income to age 101\. The paper proceeds to
examine a variety of worst\-case scenarios drawn from the two\-century historical record, in the US and globally,
115withtheworstcasesex\-USAlimitedtomarketsnotsufferinganationaldisaster.IntheUS,itwasalwayspossible
to sustain income to age 100\. Globally, this could not always be achieved, with the worst shortfalls explained
by either inflation or prolonged periods of depressed asset returns. In the 20th century US, the analyses find
a 30/70 allocation to be inferior to a 60/40 allocation when the goal is to sustain inflation\-adjusted income
for as long as possible; globally and historically, that generalization did not hold. Next, the paper considers
whether small changes to the balanced mix, consistent with those seen in Target Date Retirement funds, could
improve outcomes; in all the cases examined, small alterations were able to improve the longevity of savings,
sometimes dramatically. The paper ends on an optimistic note: two centuries of global market history indicate
that exhaustion of tax\-sheltered retirement savings before the age of 100 is unlikely to occur for retirees who
model their asset mix after those seen in Target Date funds.

pp. 98–119\.
Inflation forecasting is an important but difficult task. Here, we explore advances in machine learning (ML)
methods and the availability of new datasets to forecast U.S. inflation. Despite the skepticism in the previous
literature, we show that ML models with a large number of covariates are systematically more accurate than
the benchmarks. The ML method that deserves more attention is the random forest model, which dominates
all other models. Its good performance is due not only to its specific method of variable selection but also the
potential nonlinearities between past key macroeconomic variables and inflation. Supplementary materials for
this article are available online.
Mendu, H. (2021\). “A critical review of ’optimal’ annuitization strategies .” MA thesis. University of Waterloo.
This paper is an analysis of different self\-annuitization strategies advised to a retiree. At the time of retirement,
an individual has the choice between annuitizing immediately with their wealth or delaying until a future date
while making the most from returns earned through financial markets. This is a similar structure to how a
Defined Contribution (DC) pension plan works. Various researchers have assisted retirees on this dilemma of
whetherornottoannuitize.Theydesignedstrategiesthatworkundergeneralmarketsettingsandanyindividual
preferences that maximize the income generation. However, these studies assume that individuals are making
decisions as if they are maximizing or behaving optimally. In reality, what might be “optimal” in a general sense
may not match the optimality defined in a normative sense of giving advice.
Merton, R. C. (2014\). “The Crisis in Retirement Planning .” In:Harvard Business Review .
Corporate America began to really take notice of the looming retirement crisis in the wake of the dot\-com
crash, when companies in major industries went bankrupt in large part because of their inability to meet their
pension obligations. The result was an acceleration of America’s shift away from employer\-sponsored pension
plans toward defined\-contribution plans – epitomized by the ubiquitous 401(k) – which transfer the investment
risk from the company to the employee.
With that transfer has come a dangerous shift in investment focus, argues Nobel Laureate Robert C. Merton.
Traditional pension plans were conceived and managed to provide members with a guaranteed income. And
because that objective filtered right through the scheme, members thought of their benefits in those terms. Ask
a member what her pension is worth and she’ll reply with an income figure: ”two\-thirds of my final salary,”
for example. Most DC schemes, however, are designed and managed as investment accounts with the goal of
accumulating the largest possible pot of savings. Communication with savers is framed entirely in terms of assets
and returns. Ask a saver what his 401(k) is worth and you’ll hear a cash amount and perhaps a lament to the
value lost in the financial crisis.
The trouble is that investment value and asset volatility are simply the wrong measures if your goal is to secure
a particular future income. In this article, Merton explains a liability\-driven investment strategy whose aim is
to improve the probability of achieving a desired retirement income rather than to maximize the capital value
of the savings.

This paper offers an integrated approach to addressing the global retirement funding challenge, especially in light
of the coronavirus shock that has created an unanticipated and unprecedented impact on lifetime income/con\-
sumption. It frames the problem in a six\-component approach to the funding challenge with an integrated
package presented in a transparent, detailed modular fashion, so that any one module can be replaced with a
different version and the rest of the system works. This also means that all six components need not be employed
116simultaneously, but can be done in a secular fashion. Finally, it develops and proposes in detail a new financial
instrument, SeLFIES (Standard\-of\-Living indexed, Forward\-starting, Income\-only Securities)\-a single financial
innovation that provides greatly improved efficiency of implementation to four of the six components. SeLFIES
can help complete financial markets and could be a timely innovation given the coronavirus crisis because they
are beneficial to governments that seek long\-term, local currency debt financing.

There is a looming retirement crisis, as individuals are increasingly being asked to take responsibility for their

basic compounding calculations and do not understand the impact of inflation, both critical aspects of retirement

decisions: how much to save, how to invest (with many additional decisions), and how to decumulate one
portfolio at retirement. Compounding these challenges, current financial instruments and products (e.g. T\-Bills,
TIPs, or Target Date Funds) are risky because they focus on the wrong goal \- wealth at retirement, as opposed
to how much retirement income can be guaranteed to support pre\-retirement standard\-of\-living. Moreover,
annuities are complex, costly, and illiquid and seldom used. Without financial innovation and a change in the

Suppose a client just retired and has funds in a tax\-deferred account like a 401(k), a tax\-exempt account like
a Roth IRA, and a taxable account. She needs to withdraw sufficient funds to finance her spending plans in

Milevsky, M. A. (2006\). Calculus of Retirement Income: Financial Models for Pension Annuities and Life Insurance .
Cambridge University Press.
This 2006 book introduces and develops the basic actuarial models and underlying pricing of life\-contingent
pension annuities and life insurance from a unique financial perspective. The ideas and techniques are then
applied to the real\-world problem of generating sustainable retirement income towards the end of the human
life\-cycle. The role of lifetime income, longevity insurance, and systematic withdrawal plans are investigated in a
parsimonious framework. The underlying technology and terminology of the book are based on continuous\-time
financial economics by merging analytic laws of mortality with the dynamics of equity markets and interest rates.
Nonetheless, the book requires a minimal background in mathematics and emphasizes applications and examples
more than proofs and theorems. It can serve as an ideal textbook for an applied course on wealth management
and retirement planning in addition to being a reference for quantitatively\-inclined financial planners.
Milevsky, M. A. (2020a). “Calibrating Gompertz in reverse: What is your longevity\-risk\-adjusted global age? ” In:

This paper develops a computational framework for inverting Gompertz\-Makeham mortality hazard rates, con\-
sistent with compensation laws of mortality for heterogeneous populations, to define a longevity\-risk\-adjusted
global (L\-RaG) age. To illustrate its salience and possible applications, the paper calibrates and presents L\-
RaG values using country data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD). Among other things, the author
demonstrates that when properly benchmarked, the longevity\-risk\-adjusted global age of a 55\-year\-old Swedish
male is 48, whereas a 55\-year\-old Russian male is closer in age to 67\. The paper also discusses the connection
between the proposed L\-RaG age and the related concept of Biological age, from the medical and gerontology
literature. Practically speaking, in a world of growing mortality heterogeneity, the L\-RaG age could be used
117for pension and retirement policy. In the language of behavioral finance and economics, a salient metric that
adjusts chronological age for longevity risk might help capture the public attention, educate them about lifetime
uncertainty and induce many of them to take action —such as working longer and/or retiring later.

(DIAs) within target\-date funds (TDF) in defined contribution (DC) plans, although the algorithm could also
be applied within any retirement account. We map a relatively small number of statistical parameters into
a rule that conveys the dollar amount of DIAs to be purchased at any given age and time. Our model is of
particular relevance given the recent announcement by the U.S. Treasury Department approving the inclusion of
life annuities in 401(k) plans and in TDFs in particular. Note that to qualify as a TDF requires a methodology
based on generally accepted investment theories using a consistent investment strategy. This article offers one
possible such theory in the context of DIAs.

Practitioners are well aware of the pernicious effect of the of investment returns on retirement income sustain\-
ability. Poor markets early in the withdrawal phase increase the ruin probability and reduce the longevity of
a portfolio. In this article, the authors investigate how and when traded equity options can be used to extend
the life of a retiree investments. They label this class of strategies longevity extension overlays (LEOs) and use
simulation techniques to analyze the strategy theoretical properties. They also provide evidence on the efficacy
of simple LEOs during the 2007\-2013 period. Our results are encouraging and offer a justifiable alternative for
wealth managers who want to avoid using (more complex and opaque) insurance\-product solutions.
Milevsky, M. A., Salisbury, T. S., and Chigodaev, A. (2018\). “The implied longevity curve: How long does the
market think you are going to live? ” In:arXiv e\-Print .
We use life annuity prices to extract information about human longevity using a framework that links the term
structure of mortality and interest rates. We invert the model and perform nonlinear least squares to obtain
implied longevity forecasts. Methodologically, we assume a Cox\-Ingersoll\-Ross (CIR) model for the underlying
yield curve, and for mortality, a Gompertz\-Makeham (GM) law that varies with the year of annuity purchase.
Our main result is that over the last decade markets implied an improvement in longevity of of 6\-7 weeks per year
for males and 1\-3 weeks for females. In the year 2004 market prices implied a 40\.1% probability of survival to the
age 90 for a 75\-year old male (51\.2% for a female) annuitant. By the year 2013 the implied survival probability
had increased to 46\.1% (and 53\.1%). The corresponding implied life expectancy has increased (at the age of 75\)
from 13\.09 years for males (15\.08 years for females) to 14\.28 years (and 15\.61 years.) Although these values are
implied directly from markets, they are consistent with demographic projections. Similar to implied volatility
in option pricing, we believe that our implied survival probabilities (ISP) and implied life expectancy (ILE) are
relevant for the financial management of assets post\-retirement and very important for the optimal timing and
allocation to annuities; procrastinators are swimming against an uncertain but rather strong longevity trend.

SSRN e\-Print .
Whovalueslifeannuitiesmore?Isitthehealthyretireewhoexpectstolivelongandmightbecomeacentenarian,
or is the unhealthy retiree with a short life expectancy more likely to appreciate the pooling of longevity risk?
What if the unhealthy retiree is pooled with someone who is much healthier and thus forced to pay an implicit
loading? To answer these and related questions this paper examines the empirical conditions under which retirees
benefit (or may not) from longevity risk pooling by linking the economics of annuity equivalent wealth (AEW)
to actuarially models of aging. I focus attention on the Compensation Law of Mortality which implies that
individuals with higher relative mortality (e.g. lower income) age more slowly and experience greater longevity
uncertainty. Ergo, they place higher utility value on the annuity. The impetus for this research today is the
increasing evidence on the growing disparity in longevity expectations between rich and poor.
Milevsky, M. A. (2020b). “Biological (and Other) Ages .” In:Retirement Income Recipes in R . Springer International
Publishing, pp. 259–279\.
This chapter examines the implications of mortality heterogeneity, that is the dispersion of longevity prospects
within the population. It begins by discussing the extended Gompertz\-Makeham model, as well as the com\-
pensation law of mortality, linking moments of the remaining lifetime random variable. It then introduces non\-
chronological measures of age, such as biological age and (especially) longevity risk\-adjusted age to illustrate its
118dispersion. This chapter illustrates how true age can differ around the world and even within countries, based
on wealth and income. The main computational implication of this chapter is that the human longevity random
variable Tx, depends on (much) more than just chronological age x. Such heterogeneity must be accounted for
in any intelligent drawdown methodology or pensionization scheme.
Milevsky, M. A. (2020c). “Intelligent Drawdown Rates .” In:Retirement Income Recipes in R . Springer International
Publishing, pp. 209–232\.
This chapter, which could have been called rational decumulation, introduces dynamic risk\-adjusted approaches
to spending during retirement. The intelligent drawdown philosophy is contrasted with static approaches, such
as the 4% rule and its variants, the focus of prior chapters. The material begins with a light\-hearted game that
develops an intuition for how longevity uncertainty should affect retirement spending as well as a discussion of
the benefits from risk pooling. Moving on to the technical content, after a brief crash course on utility theory,
the chapter develops algorithms for (1\) computing optimal withdrawal rates based on risk aversion preferences
and (2\) adjusting ongoing spending based on realized financial and longevity variables. One of the surprising
aspects of an intelligent approach to retirement spending is that planning to deplete one’s liquid wealth at some
advanced age is ”rationale” if you have ample pension annuity income.

mathematical derivation and implementation of a closed\-form expression for the Gompertz Annuity Valuation
Model.
Milevsky, M. A. (2020e). “Modeling Human Longevity and Life Tables .” In:Retirement Income Recipes in R .
Springer International Publishing, pp. 111–130\.
Up to this point in the book, I have assumed a great fiction, namely that human longevity is known and finite.
The success or failure of a retirement income plan was monitored and measured until a finite, e.g. 30 year,
horizon. This chapter is the first to focus on the uncertainty or randomness in human longevity versus portfolio
longevity. It begins with a detailed description and analysis of (historical) cohort life tables from the Human
Mortality Database. The cohort life tables are used to extract population survival and death rates, which are
then used to reconstruct life tables. The chapter concludes with a high\-level discussion of mortality projections
and improvements for future birth cohorts. The main emphasis is on gaining familiarity with the basic atomic
structure (qx) of actuarial life\-science.

This chapter is focused on a phenomenon known by professionals in the retirement income business, as the
sequence\-of\-returns effect. Broadly speaking – and using terminology introduced in the previous chapter – this
relates to the disproportionate sensitivity of portfolio longevity to realized investment returns in the early stages
of retirement withdrawals. More specifically this chapter proposes some formal metrics that measure the extent
and magnitude of the risk using statistical correlation and regression methodologies. The chapter concludes by
analyzing some derivative\-based strategies, using put and call options, that can be used to mitigate the risk of
sequence\-of\-returns.

This book provides computational tools that readers can use to flourish in the retirement income industry. Each
chapter describes recipe\-like algorithms and explains how to implement them via simple scripts in the freely
available R coding language. Students can use those skills to generate quantitative answers to the most common
questions in retirement income planning, as well as to develop a deeper understanding of the finance and eco\-
nomics underlying the field itself. The book will be an excellent asset for experienced students who are interested
in advanced wealth management, and specifically within courses that focus on holistic modeling of the retirement
income process. The material will also be useful to current and future wealth management professionals within
119the financial services industry. Readers should have a solid understanding of financial principles, as well as a
rudimentary background in economics and accounting.
Miller, A. K. (2015\). “Improving Withdrawal Rates in a Low Yield World .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Decreased real bond yields substantially increase failure rates for portfolios with an initial 4% withdrawal rate.
One way to increase the safe withdrawal rate of a portfolio is to decrease the allocation to bonds and to increase
the allocation to stocks. Unfortunately, increasing the allocation to stocks dramatically changes the risk profile
of the portfolio. I propose that a solution to this conundrum is to use a low volatility stock portfolio as the
primary asset class in the portfolio. A portfolio constructed primarily of low volatility stocks allows an investor
to decrease the allocation to lower yielding bonds while still maintaining a similar risk profile to a traditional
50% stock and 50% bond portfolio.

Approach .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Life annuities and pension products usually involve a number of guarantees, such as minimum accumulation
rates, minimum annual payments or a minimum total payout. Packaging different types of guarantees is the
feature of so\-called variable annuities. Basically, these products are unit\-linked investment policies providing
a post\-retirement income. The guarantees, commonly referred to as GMxBs (namely, Guaranteed Minimum
Benefits of type ’x’), include minimum benefits both in case of death and survival. In this paper we propose a
unifying framework for the valuation of variable annuities under quite general model assumptions. We compute
and compare contract values and fair fee rates under ’static’ and ’mixed’ valuation approaches, via ordinary and
least squares Monte Carlo methods, respectively.

Mitchell, J. B. (2009a). “A Mean\-Variance Approach to Withdrawal Rate Management: Theory and Simulation .”
In:SSRN e\-Print .
Withdrawal rate management of retirement portfolios (decumulation) is explored in a traditional mean\-variance
context. The paper demonstrates that improvements in the composition of portfolios and in the management of
withdrawal rates can both be thought of as increasing the opportunity cost price of annuitizing and reducing the
optimal risk of portfolios. Increases in age are shown to have three separate components: decreasing remaining
expected lifespan; decreasing variability of remaining lifespan; and increasing variability of returns over remain\-
ing holding period. The difficulty of employing a mean\-variance approach when a portion of the variation in
returns is absorbed by variation in the ending portfolio is noted.
The second portion of the paper demonstrates these principles with simulation analysis. A zero\-tolerance
(MAXSAFE) approach, as proposed by Bengen, is combined with a multiple\-factor withdrawal management
strategy, as developed by Stout and Mitchell, to generate a series of risk\-return frontiers based on data from
1926\-2008\.
Improvements in risk\-return relationships are found using more restrictive withdrawal rate management ap\-
proaches than previously reported in the literature. Restricting withdrawal rates when retirees no longer have
1\.45 times the present value of their expected withdrawals combined with limitations on withdrawal rate in\-
creases allow most retirees to experience average withdrawal rates in excess of 5\.5% with average withdrawal
rates in excess of 6% and with only a .1% chance of ruin before death.

This paper builds on the work of Stout and Mitchell (2006\), Stout (2008\), and Blanchett and Frank (2009\) by
creating a preventive approach to withdrawal management. Proactive strategies, which reduce the withdrawal
rate before there are insufficient funds, are shown to significantly reduce the probability of ruin (shortfall) while
maintainingtheaveragewithdrawalrate.Thepaperalsoexploresthemicroeffectsofstrategychangesbydividing
the simulation iterations into groups which have been positively or negatively affected by any particular change,
and demonstrates that conventional reporting of the effectiveness of withdrawal rate management techniques
can be improved by examining additional moments of the distribution. Data covers 1926\-2008 and the mortality
table is extended to 108 years.
Mitchell, J. B. (2016\). “Migrating with Black Swans: Climate Risk and Retirement Planning .” In:The Journal of
Retirement 4(2\), pp. 24–36\.
120This article combines the thoughts of several authors to describe the migration of retirees through the retirement
phase of their lives during a time of climate change. Taleb \[2007] introduced the concept of the Black Swan,
the (hopefully) infrequent but significant disruption of investment returns. Bernstein \[2013] discussed sources
of risk in portfolio design and the concept of deep risk, the long\-term loss of real capital. Frank, Mitchell,
and Blanchett \[2012], among others, demonstrated how retirees move through retirement, frequently adjusting
to changes in market performance and personal expectations of longevity. Nordhaus \[2013] investigated the
potential effects of climate change on economic performance and equity returns. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change reports outlined many of the possible underlying climate changes that are likely to drive
these risks and necessitate adjustment on the part of retirees. These sources, and others, motivate this article’s
exploration of climate change, its economic implications, and how retirees might cope as they migrate through
their final years. Suggestions are made for how financial planners should prepare themselves and their clients
for climate change\-related risks.
Mitchell, J. B. and Felton, Z. S. (2015\). “Same\-Sex Couples and Sustainable Retirement Withdrawal Rates .” In:
SSRN e\-Print .
This paper compares sustainable retirement withdrawal rates for same\-sex versus heterosexual couples. Due
to convergence of expected longevity for males and females at typical retirement ages, systematic differences
between same\-sex versus heterosexual couples are slight, ranging from .03% at age 50 to less than .4% at age
85\. Therefore, same\-sex couples can employ conventional withdrawal rate recommendations with, at most, slight
modification. Due to a lack of public data regarding mortality differences based on sexual orientation, differences
in mortality expectations between individual members of same\-sex and heterosexual couples cannot be explored.
Members of same\-sex couples, like all retirees, should adjust withdrawal rate expectations periodically to reflect
individual conditions.

In:How Persistent Low Returns Will Shape Saving and Retirement . Oxford University Press.
Financial market developments over the past decade have undermined what was once thought to be conventional
wisdom about saving, investment, and retirement spending. How Persistent Low Returns Will Shape Saving and
Retirement explores how the weak capital market performance predicted for the next several years will shape
pension saving, investment, and decumulation plans. Academics, policymakers, and industry leaders debate
alternative strategies to cope with these challenges globally, as economic growth remains slow and low returns
become the ’new normal.’ This volume includes contributions from plan sponsors, benefit specialists, actuaries,
academics, regulators, and others working to design resilient pensions for the next decades. Together, they
identify several new tools for retirement savers and pension managers.

Pension Economics and Finance , pp. 1–18\.
Target\-date funds in corporate retirement plans grew from $5 billion in 2000 to $734 billion in 2018, partly
because federal regulation sanctioned these as default investments in automatic enrollment plans. We show that
adopters delegated pension investment decisions to fund managers selected by plan sponsors. Inclusion of these
funds in retirement saving menus raised equity shares, boosted bond exposures, curtailed cash/company stock
holdings, and reduced idiosyncratic risk. The adoption of low\-cost target\-date funds may enhance retirement
wealth by as much as 50% over a 30\-year horizon.

In:Journal of Asset Management 11(2\-3\), pp. 71–72\.
The demographics of the global community of working people are moving in a clear direction, essentially we
are living longer. The requirement of financial care through pensions for this ageing population is becoming an
important problem not only in the advanced economies but also in the emerging economies. This special issue
brings together a collection of papers by a number of experts who have studied different facets of the pension
problem. In recent years the pension fund industry has adopted tailor\-made asset and liability management
(ALM) strategies, also called liability\-driven investment (LDI). The focus of the special issue is on quantitative
methodsforALM/LDIforpensionsfunds.TheaimofLDIstrategiesistomatchandoutperformapensionfund’s
liability stream and, at the same time, take into account country\-specific regulations. The decision models as well
as simulation/evaluation models which take into consideration stochastic asset price dynamics and stochastic
behaviour of the liabilities are covered. Inflation risk, interest rate risk, contribution risk of the pension plan’s
sponsor and no doubt the longevity risk of its members, are examples of additional risk some or all of which are

Yang, Gondzio and Grothey also investigate the issue of computational tractability of an asset allocation model,
which is based on second\-order stochastic dominance for the purpose of risk control. Their computational study
underlines how exploitation of structure and use of interior point optimisation can lead to efficient solution of
the computational decision models. Asset pricing is the focus of the paper by Dempster, Medova and Villaverde.
The authors present a three\-factor term structure interest rate model for consol bond valuation. They discuss a
detailed computational study and simulation results and present a detailed analysis of the yield curves. Given
that almost all pension funds include fixed income assets in one form or other, this paper clearly makes a
very important contribution to the valuation of this class of assets. Mulvey, Kim and Ma present a paper in
which they first highlight the present situation that large corporate and public funds have become underfunded
and thereby mismatched during the recent prolonged recessionary period. Their contribution is in proposing
a strategy of incorporating a duration enhancing overlay to the pension fund assets, thereby controlling the
underlying risk. Berkelaar and Kouwenberg address the question of asset allocation from an extremely novel
perspective. They state that the goal of the investment policy should be to maximise expected excess returns
over liabilities subject to an acceptable level of risk expressed relative to liabilities. Their asset allocation is based
on drawdown risk optimisation and through simulation studies they show that their strategy leads to better
downside protection. Ferstl and Weissensteiner study short\-term treasury management strategies. They develop
a multistage stochastic programming model, which in turns uses a scenario generator with no arbitrage interest
rate model with market price estimation and change of measure. Finally, they carry out extensive back testing
to validate their model. Overall, we believe we have here an exciting collection of research papers which truly
reflect the state of the art. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the editor for suggesting this special
issue; grateful thanks are also due to Michael Dempster and Katharina Schwaiger for assistance in preparing it.
Mladina, P. (2014\). “Dynamic Asset Allocation with Horizon Risk: Revisiting Glide Path Construction .” In:The
Journal of Wealth Management 16(4\), pp. 18–26\.
We compare the empirical distributions of equity and fixed\-income returns at different time horizons and find
that the risk of equities relative to fixed income is more acute at short time horizons than long time horizons,
confirming previous research. This creates the opportunity to develop a dynamic asset allocation process that
exploits the reduced horizon risk of equities relative to fixed income. We highlight key data on changing rel\-
ative risk with time and leverage this information to introduce methods and concepts that inform glide path
construction\-the building blocks for a dynamic asset allocation process that can support lifecycle, target date
retirement, and goals\-based investing frameworks.
Mladina, P. (2016\). “Optimal Lifetime Asset Allocation with Goals\-Based, Lifecycle Glide Paths .” In:The Journal

Assets should serve a purpose: to fund a lifetime of financial goals. If assets serve the purpose of funding lifetime
goals, it naturally follows that optimal lifetime asset allocation should be goals\-based and multi\-period, requiring
customizationaccording togoals, humancapital, and riskpreference. Ideally,riskpreference isdefined intuitively
for private investors. We present a dynamic asset allocation method based on an intertemporal capital asset
pricing model that incorporates these features to produce a goals\-based lifecycle glide path – an asset allocation
roadmap that optimally funds lifetime consumption goals while adapting to evolving conditions.

Taxes introduce certain complexities, requiring proper adjustments to return and risk parameters. The author
offers a refined set of after\-tax return and risk equations for use in practice and validates them with a stochas\-
tic future value cash flow model. The refined after\-tax return and risk parameters can be used in portfolio
optimization, Monte Carlo simulation, and deterministic present/future value portfolio modeling with inter\-
nally consistent results. The refinements improve the discovery of the optimal after\-tax portfolio and enhance
long\-term wealth planning in the presence of risk.

122The retirement goals of many Americans are underfunded. The problem is compounded by the complexity of
self\-managing distribution portfolios, particularly as DC plans replace DB plans. We believe most retirement
glide paths are satisfactory but suboptimal solutions. We introduce a glide path of financial assets over the
life cycle based on a retirement goal and depleting human capital. The method is anchored to the foundational
principles of intertemporal portfolio theory while borrowing heavily from goals\-based asset allocation. The result
is a dynamic asset allocation over the life cycle that is a function of critical input variables relevant to retirement
planning such as retirementsavings, retirement consumption and risk aversion. The glide path can be customized
to individuals, or semi\-customized to discrete subpopulations of DC plan participants.
Moehle, N., Kochenderfer, M. J., Boyd, S., and Ang, A. (2021\). “Tax\-Aware Portfolio Construction via Convex
Optimization .” In:arXiv e\-Print .
We describe an optimization\-based tax\-aware portfolio construction method that adds tax liability to standard
Markowitz\-based portfolio construction. Our method produces a trade list that specifies the number of shares
to buy of each asset and the number of shares to sell from each tax lot held. To avoid wash sales (in which
some realized capital losses are disallowed), we assume that we trade monthly, and cannot simultaneously buy
and sell the same asset. The tax\-aware portfolio construction problem is not convex, but it becomes convex
when we specify, for each asset, whether we buy or sell it. It can be solved using standard mixed\-integer convex
optimization methods at the cost of very long solve times for some problem instances. We present a custom
convex relaxation of the problem that borrows curvature from the risk model. This relaxation can provide a
good approximation of the true tax liability, while greatly enhancing computational tractability. This method
requires the solution of only two convex optimization problems: the first determines whether we buy or sell each
asset, and the second generates the final trade list. In our numerical experiments, our method almost always
solves the nonconvex problem to optimality, and when it does not, it produces a trade list very close to optimal.
Backtests show that the performance of our method is indistinguishable from that obtained using a globally
optimal solution, but with significantly reduced computational effort.
Moenig, T. (2021\). “It’s RILA Time: An Introduction to Registered Index\-Linked Annuities .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Registered index\-linked annuities (RILAs) are increasingly popular equity\-based retirement savings products
offered by U.S. life insurance companies. They combine features of fixed\-index annuities and traditional variable
annuities (TVAs), offering investors equity exposure with downside protection in a tax\-deferred setting. This
article introduces RILAs to the academic literature by describing the products’ key features, developing a
general pricing model, and deriving the providers’ hedging strategy by decomposing their liabilities into short\-
term European options.
Numerical illustrations show that RILAs offer investors similar risk profiles (in the long run) as TVAs with
maturity guarantees, and that many products currently sold appear to be priced quite favorably for investors.
For providers, RILAs may be a preferable alternative or complement to TVAs as they greatly simplify the
management of the embedded equity risk and can naturally reduce the TVA capital requirements. These features
position RILAs as a viable long\-term solution for this product space.

This study develops a behavioral portfolio selection model that uses a robust estimator for expected returns in
order to produce portfolios with less need to change over consecutive periods. We also consider investor attitudes
toward risk through spectral risk measure as well as investor expectations on future returns by means of the
Black\-Litterman model, and finally, our model includes a varying risk aversion depending on investor behavioral
biases and his latest realized return. In order to evaluate the proposed model and make comparisons possible,
we conducted a survey on investor biases and attitudes along with market data of Tehran Stock Exchange. The
results reveal that although our model is not mean\-variance efficient, it recommends portfolios that are robust,
well diversified, and have less utility loss compared to a famous behavioral portfolio model.

Analyses .” In:The Journal of Retirement 8(2\), pp. 23–38\.
The vulnerability of individuals planning for retirement has been growing as a result of the conversion from
defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, the steady increase in life longevity, and the uncertainty of
asset returns under an ever\-changing global environment. A serious problem is the lack of appropriate planning
for retirement. How much should an individual in the United States save beyond the Social Security tax to
maintain a reasonable lifestyle after retirement? The article designs a framework to facilitate the process of
setting realistic goals for retirement planning, featuring the concept of agent\-based simulations. Focusing on
policy\-rule\-based investment strategies, the simulation framework includes multiple investable asset categories
and explores dynamic allocation based on the investor’s age, current salary, and Social Security accumulation
situation. Empirical results demonstrate a stylized application of the planning framework.
Munnell, A. H., Sanzenbacher, G., Webb, A., and Gillis, C. M. (2016\). “Are Early Claimers Making a Mistake? ”
In:SSRN e\-Print .
Using Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data and Latent Class Analysis for three cohorts (those born in
1931\-1936, 1937\-1941, and 1942\-1947\), this paper explores: 1\) who claims Social Security benefits at age 62; 2\)
what percentage of households claiming at 62 are unprepared for retirement; and 3\) whether the unprepared
early claimers were pushed into claiming through job shocks and/or poor health or simply decided to take
benefits early. Looking across three cohorts makes it possible to see whether these patterns have changed as
the average claim age has increased and pension coverage has shifted away from defined benefit (DB) plans.
That is, have those who have moved out of age\-62 claiming been educated, financially prepared households or
unprepared households that have recognized the need to delay claiming?
The paper found that:
•Consistent with previous research, the HRS shows a decline in those claiming at 62\.
•Age\-62 claimers are less well off than ”postponers” in some ways and better off in others.
•Latent class analysis shows that this mixed picture reflects the average of: 1\) those with little education
and poor job prospects (disadvantaged); and 2\) those with at least some college and sufficient resources to
claim early (advantaged).
•The percentage of the age\-62 claimers in each of these groups has remained virtually constant over the
three cohorts.
•Comparing the calculated household replacement rates with target rates from previous research shows that,
overall, roughly 65 percent of households claiming at 62 are not prepared; the rate for the disadvantaged
group is twice the rate of the advantaged group.
•The percentage unprepared at 62 has increased over time, reflecting an overall trend toward less prepared\-
ness.
•A simple probit regression suggests that health and employment shocks and the absence of a DB pension
are related to the lack of preparedness for both the disadvantaged and advantaged.
The policy implications of the findings are:
•Given the increasing trend in unpreparedness, further cuts to Social Security benefits would exacerbate
this problem.
•Workers claiming at 62 with DB plans were especially likely to be prepared; these plans are not coming
back, so the challenge is whether the 401(k) system can be enhanced.

Munnell, A. H. and Webb, A. (2021\). “The Impact of Leakages from 401(k)s and IRAs .” In:The Journal of
Retirement 9(3\), pp. 32–54\.
This article summarizes what is known about leakages from existing studies and relates these results to detailed
data on leakages in 2013 provided by Vanguard’s How America Saves. It then uses two data sets \- the Survey of
Consumer Finances and the Survey of Income and Program Participation \- to estimate the impact of leakages
on wealth at retirement. The Vanguard data are a critical component because they provide a comprehensive
picture of assets and participant flows, whereas the surveys on which earlier studies were based tended to focus
on one component, such as loans. A key limitation is that Vanguard’s population is probably wealthier than the
general population.
124Munnell, A. H., Wettstein, G., and Hou, W. (2019\). “How Best to Annuitize Defined Contribution Assets? ” In:
SSRN e\-Print .
Unlike defined benefit pensions that provide participants with steady benefits for as long as they live, 401(k)
plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) provide little guidance on how to turn accumulated assets into
income. As a result, retirees have to decide how much to withdraw each year and face the risk of either spending
too quickly and outliving their resources or spending too conservatively and consuming too little. Surveys of
individuals’ plans and several recent studies suggest that people will not draw down their accumulations for fear
that they will exhaust their money and be unable to cover end\-of\-life health care costs. They also must consider
how to invest their savings after retirement. These are difficult decisions.
Better strategies are possible that will ensure a higher level of lifetime income, reduce the likelihood that people
will outlive their resources, and alleviate some of the anxiety associated with post\-retirement investing. Work\-
ers could use a portion of their 401(k) and IRA assets to purchase an immediate annuity that pays a fixed
amount throughout their lives, typically starting at age 65\. Or they could purchase an advanced life deferred
annuity (ALDA) that requires a smaller share of accumulated assets and begins payments at a later age like 85\.
Alternatively, they could use their assets to delay claiming Social Security \- essentially purchasing an inflation\-
indexed annuity. Right now, none of these three options is commonly used. Very few workers choose to purchase
immediate or deferred annuities (the first two options). And few retirees appear to be deferring claiming in
order to receive the maximum annuity income from Social Security \- most people simply retire earlier and claim
immediately.
Increasing annuitization in a meaningful way would require embedding annuities in 401(k) plans, with annuiti\-
zation as the default. Recent proposed federal legislation, such as the SECURE Act (Setting Every Community
Up for Retirement Enhancement), encourages plan sponsors to offer annuities in their plans by establishing a
fiduciary safe harbor when specific statutory conditions are followed in selecting an insurance company. This
legislation does not address, however, the question of defaults or the possibility of using 401(k) assets to pur\-
chase additional Social Security benefits. Moving forward on these fronts would require some consensus about
the appropriate share of 401(k) assets to be annuitized and the best method for annuitizing them.
To address these issues, this paper compares the level of lifetime utility generated by alternative annuitization
approaches \- immediate annuities, deferred annuities, and additional Social Security through delayed claiming.
The analysis also tests different assumptions for the share of initial wealth that participants use to purchase
these products.
Muralidhar, A., Shin, S. H., and Ohashi, K. (2016\). “The Most Basic Missing Instrument in Financial Markets: The
Case for Forward Starting Bonds .” In:The Journal of Investment Consulting 17(2\).
There is a looming retirement crisis globally with the three pillars of retirement threatened because of insufficient
funding, improper investment decisions, and transferring risk to individuals who are least capable of bearing
such risk. This paper argues that the introduction of a unique financial instrument, basically an inflation linked
bond which pays coupons when you need it, might help ameliorate this crisis.
The Life Cycle Hypothesis (LCH) demonstrated why people save; namely, they try to set aside resources during
their working lives, to be able to tap into them to ensure retirement income when labor income stops. Modern
Portfolio Theory (MPT) attempted to help individuals make optimal investment decisions on these savings by
investing in stocks, bonds and other assets to ensure sufficient retirement wealth. There are three problems
with using MPT approaches for retirement planning: (a) MPT ignores the uses of funds; (b) focuses on wealth
as opposed to retirement income maximization; and (b) none of these assets is an ideal hedge for a desired
retirement income. As a result, seemingly safe MPT assets are risky from a retirement income perspective
(because the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a specific case of a more general Relative Asset Pricing
Model (RAPM)).
The need for our bond is simple: the riskless retirement asset is an inflation\-indexed, coupon\-only bond that
defers payment until retirement and pays till death. All attempts to recreate this profile through traditional
stocks and bonds, or purchase such a profile through annuities are sub\-optimal, risky, complex or expensive
thereby threatening retirement security. The paper goes further to demonstrate that there is a potentially
willing supplier of such bonds, and that this bond offers the perfect offsetting cash flow profile to infrastructure
projects, thereby completing the market. It also addresses challenges, issues and opportunities surrounding such
an instrument and examines issues relating to the creation of a market for FSBs.

125This study identifies and validates a set of scorable retirement income factors to define preferences for an overall
retirement income style. This investigation further attempts to create a workable model for retirement income
planning by showing how the factors connect to four main retirement income strategies: systematic withdrawals
with total return investing, risk wrap with deferred annuities, protected income with immediate annuities, and
time segmentation or bucketing. Approaching retirement income agnostically and matching retirement income
strategies based on an individual’s personal retirement income style may lead to improved outcomes that achieve
greater ”buy in” and comfort.

the Advisor Usefulness and Retirement Income Self\-Efficacy scales to successfully identify preferred financial
implementation methods. This can assist individuals in more readily recognizing their relative strengths and
weaknesses when implementing a retirement income strategy, and financial professionals can present advice in
a manner that addresses a client’s concerns and preferred implementation.

Over the past three decades, a sustained surge in inflation has been absent in developed markets. As a result,
investors face the challenge of having limited experience and no recent data to guide the repositioning of their
portfolios in the face of heighted inflation risk. We provide some insight by analyzing both passive and active
strategies across a variety of asset classes for the U.S., U.K., and Japan over the past 95 years. Unexpected
inflation is bad news for traditional assets, such as bonds and equities, with local inflation having the greatest
effect. Commodities have positive returns during inflation surges but there is considerable variation within the
commodity complex. Among the dynamic strategies, we find that trend\-following provides the most reliable
protection during important inflation shocks. Active equity factor strategies also provide some degree of hedging
ability. We also provide analysis of alternative asset classes such as fine art and discuss the economic rationale
for including cryptocurrencies as part of a strategy to protect against inflation.

static hedging using longevity bonds and derivatives .” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 49(1\), pp. 100–
114\.
Formanyyears,thelongevityriskofindividualshasbeenunderestimated,assurvivalprobabilitieshaveimproved
across the developed world. The uncertainty and volatility of future longevity has posed significant risk issues
for both individuals and product providers of annuities and pensions. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
static hedging strategies for longevity risk management using longevity bonds and derivatives (qq\-forwards) for
the retail products: life annuity, deferred life annuity, indexed life annuity, and variable annuity with guaranteed
lifetime benefits. Improved market and mortality models are developed for the underlying risks in annuities.
The market model is a regime\-switching vector error correction model for GDP, inflation, interest rates, and
share prices. The mortality model is a discrete\-time logit model for mortality rates with age dependence. Models
were estimated using Australian data. The basis risk between annuitant portfolios and population mortality was
126based on UK experience. Results show that static hedging using qq\-forwards or longevity bonds reduces the
longevity risk substantially for life annuities, but significantly less for deferred annuities. For inflation\-indexed
annuities, static hedging of longevity is less effective because of the inflation risk. Variable annuities provide
limited longevity protection compared to life annuities and indexed annuities, and as a result longevity risk
hedging adds little value for these products.
Nicolas, F. (2019\). Investment Strategies for Retirement . World Scientific. 416 pp.
The issue of pension financing is evolving everywhere, becoming more of a corporate or individual matter rather
than a state one. Demographic changes are making sharing mechanisms hard to control, and social deficits
often lead governments to pull back from their obligations. This raises many questions for the individual: 1\) At
what age should I start saving? When should I increase or reduce my savings? 2\) How do I secure my income?
3\) What products should I choose to supplement my pension and savings? 4\) What degree of risk should I
take on? Despite the burden for securing one’s retirement increasingly placed on individuals, many are often
badly prepared to tackle this very long savings process, which is often complicated by the specific characteristics
of a pension plan. This publication, intended for investment professionals, customer advisors, and individuals
interested in personal finance and asset management, looks at some of the fundamental elements of investment
strategies and techniques for retirement.
Novotny, L. E. and Mansson, A. (2020\). “Finding the Optimal Withdrawal Rate on a Retirement Portfolio .” MA
thesis. Copenhagen Business School.
This thesis seeks to illuminate how investors may withdraw optimally from their retirement portfolio, consid\-
ering personal attributes, to maximize their lifetime utility. It thereby challenges the popular existing research
conducted by Cooley et al. (1999\)which investigates a sustainable withdrawal rate, mainly by using the over\-
lapping period method. The main finding of the thesis is, that the personal attributes of the investors heavily
impacts their recommended payment plans, suggesting that the generic sustainable withdrawal rate presented
by Cooley et al. (1999\) hardly can be used as a basis for planning retirement. To do this, this study specifies a
utility framework, which is being used as a tool for assessing investor utility by given payout plans, considering a
series of personal traits, mainly including subjective discount rate, constant relative risk aversion, time horizon,
habit consumption and the loss aversion of the investor. The thesis then assesses optimal investor payout plans
with an exogenously given rate of return, thus excluding risk. Subsequently the study introduces uncertainty on
the investment assets, making the optimization problem more complex. To assess risk, the thesis considers two
assets with their simulated returns being provided by Monte Carlo simulation and bootstrapping simulation,
over a 30\-year time horizon. These are then indexed and used for providing optimal payment plans considering
lower returns given by the utilization of tail risk measures such as Value at Risk. The thesis finally attempts
to show the diversity in optimal withdrawals by applying the utility framework to the fictious case examples,
and by using the data from the simulations. Despite only being a fictious case, the stereotypical investors each
represent qualities which are relatable to real life investors.
Owadally, I., Jang, C., and Clare, A. (2021a). “Optimal investment for a retirement plan with deferred annuities .”
In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 98, pp. 51–62\.
We construct an optimal investment portfolio model with deferred annuities for an individual investor saving
in a retirement plan. The objective function consists of power utility in terms of consumption of all secured
retirement income from the deferred annuity purchases, as well as bequest from remaining wealth invested in
equity, bond, and cash funds. The asset universe is governed by a vector autoregressive model incorporating
the Nelson\-Siegel term structure and equity returns. We use multi\-stage stochastic programming to solve the
optimization problem numerically. Deferred annuity purchases are made continuously over the working lifetime
of the investor, increasing particularly in the years before retirement. The investment strategy hedges price
changes in deferred annuities, and bond holding and deferred annuity purchases increase when interest rates are
high. Optimal investment and deferred annuity choices depend on realized and expected values of state variables.
The optimal strategy is also compared with typical retirement plan strategies such as glide paths. Our results
provide support for deferred annuities as a major source of retirement income.

ment for Retirement .” In:Sustainability 13(9\), p. 5000\.
We consider whether sustainable investment can deliver performance comparable to conventional investment in
investors’ long\-term retirement plans. On the capital markets, sustainable investment can be achieved through
various instruments and strategies, one of them being investment in mutual funds that subscribe to ESG (envi\-
ronmental, social, and governance) principles. First, we compare the investment performance of ESG funds with
127matched conventional funds over the period 1994\-2020, in Europe and the U.S. We find no significant evidence
of differing performance (at 5% level) despite using a number of investment performance metrics. Second, we
perform a historical backtest to model a UK personal retirement plan from 2000 till 2020, taking full account
of investment management fees and transaction costs. We find that investing in an index\-tracker fund overlaid
with ESG screening delivers a pension which is 10\.4% larger than is achieved if the index\-tracker fund is used
without screening. This is also 20\.2% larger than is achieved by investing in a collection of actively managed
funds with a sustainable purpose. We conclude that an ESG\-screened long\-term passive investment approach
for retirement plans is likely to be successful in satisfying the twin objectives of a secure retirement income and
of sustainability.
Pae, Y. and Atra, R. (2020\). “Rules of Thumb versus Industry Glide Paths; Some Bootstrapping Evidence .” In:The
Journal of Investing 29(3\), pp. 23–27\.
We compare the performance of retirement portfolios using the average glide path of five popular target date
funds to general rules of thumb for asset allocation. Surprisingly, the industry average target date fund has
similar return and risk as the ”120 minus your age rule”. In addition, a simple ”140 minus your age rule”
produces greater expected savings at retirement and a lower failure rate for average US investors retiring in
their early 60s. A naive approach such as the ”120 minus your age” rule or the ”140 minus your age” can
benefit average US employees by reducing transaction costs, improving retirement balances and increasing the
probability of a comfortable retirement through an easy\-to\-understand investing rule.
Pakula, D. (2020\). Guiding your clients through stormy weather: Sustainable withdrawal rates in times of crisis .
Tech. rep. Vanguard.
Many investors are concerned that a severe market crisis can dramatically affect their portfolio wealth and
spending needs.
This research note uses simulated market scenarios to explore the interaction among market crises, expected
returns, and sustainable withdrawal rates.
This analysis yields two insights. First, the inverse relationship between market downturns and expected returns
may limit, but not eliminate, a downturn’s impact on sustainable spending. And second, modest spending
adjustments in response to a downturn can preserve much of a portfolio’s long\-term spending power.
Paradise, T. and Kahler, J. R. (2020\). What to do with your next dollar: A quantitative framework . Tech. rep.
Vanguard.
Our financial lives can quickly become complex. Various tools and account types are available to help us save for
an uncertain future, including employer plans, IRAs, 529s, and HSAs. But in addition to managing their assets,
most households are also juggling various liabilities, such as a mortgage or student loans. How should investors
prioritize cash flows on the household balance sheet? Should they invest more in a 401(k) or focus on paying
off their mortgage early? The goal is to maximize long\-term after\-tax net worth\-assets minus debts\-while also
meeting shorter\-term goals and spending needs. This paper introduces a framework for evaluating the best use of
your next discretionary dollar. Key to success is smart management of both sides of the balance sheet\-your assets
as well as your liabilities. Our framework has three components 1\) Understanding your investment options: It
is important to understand the costs, tax benefits, and rules of the investment opportunities available to you.
We quantify the relative return potential of several types of accounts, showing the benefits of prioritizing tax\-
advantaged vehicles. 2\) Debt: the other side of the balance sheet What are the relative benefits and constraints of
prioritizing debt prepayment over further investment? We show that prioritizing the prepayment of high\-interest
debt can lead to better outcomes and explore the behavioral, liquidity, and risk tolerance considerations involved
in the trade\-off. 3\) Balancing wealth maximization with other financial objectives Finally, we analyze the cash
allocation decision and suggest the following steps. First, prioritize matched savings and high\-cost debt. Next,
make sure you have adequate emergency savings. Last, select the highest\-returning opportunities appropriate
for your goals.

This study investigates the influence of risk tolerance on the expected utility in the long run. We estimate the

30\.
The article presents a goal\-based portfolio optimization approach that is truly native to the goal\-based environ\-
ment. It begins by redefining risk as the probability of failing to attain a specified goal and redefining reward as
the excess wealth over and above what is required by the goal. It then presents an optimization procedure that
seeks to minimize goal failure and maximize excess return. In preliminary tests, it finds that this goal\-based
procedure lowers the probability of failing to achieve a specified goal while delivering higher excess wealth than
the procedures currently available.

Parker, F. J. (2020\). “Allocation of wealth both within and across goals: a practitioner guide .” In:The Journal of
Wealth Management 23(1\), pp. 8–21\.
Although the goals\-based investment literature has grown, there remain two unsolved problems. First, there is
no cohesive theory for the allocation of wealth across goals. If, for example, a client wants to retire in thirty
years, send a child to university in eight years, and buy a vacation home in four, how she should divvy her
wealth across those goals has been an open question. Restating the same problem: The vesting of shorter\-dated
goals carries a loss of achievement probability for longer\-dated ones. How much probability loss is acceptable?
Second, mean\-variance portfolios yield lower probabilities of goal achievement than goals\-based portfolios. I
demonstrate use of the goals\-based method. Parker (2020\) introduced a cohesive goals\-based allocation model
that solves these problems. The approach, however, carries some practical challenges that are addressed in this
discussion. Finally, I discuss some possible implications of the approach on the structure of firms, the regulatory
environment, and the industry as a whole.

For investors who wish to engage in impact investing and who have specific goals to achieve, there exists the
potential for a trade\-off. When impact investments yield lower returns than nonimpact portfolios, how much
return should an investor be willing to give up to incorporate it? Using recent advances in goals\-based utility
theory, this article explores an answer to that question and offers practical and concrete advice for advisors
to individual investors and fiduciaries of trusts. Using the goals\-based framework, the author shows how an
investor’s willingness to sacrifice return for an impact investing mandate changes in response to market and
portfolio conditions.

Puzzle.” In:The Economic Journal 127(603\), pp. 1598–1625\.
We find that health cost risk lowers optimal annuity demand at retirement. If medical expenses can be sizeable
early in retirement, full annuitisation at retirement is no longer optimal because agents do not have enough
time to build a liquid wealth buffer. Furthermore, large deviations from optimal annuitisation levels lead to
small utility differences. Our results suggest that health cost risk can explain a large proportion of empirically
observed annuity choices. Finally, allowing additional annuitisation after retirement results in welfare gains of
at most 2\.5% when facing health cost risk, and negligible gains without this risk.

In:SSRN e\-Print .
129We study the performance of different investment and spending strategies for retirement. Investment strategies
include wealth\-focused glide paths that combine equities with short\-term, high\-quality fixed income. We also
consider an income\-focused glide path that combines a moderate equity allocation at retirement and an inflation\-
protected bond portfolio that uses liability\-driven investing. Spending rules include fixed spending (similar to
the 4% rule), flexible spending, as well as nominal and real annuitization. We examine simulated lifetimes with
either stochastic longevity or fixed longevity of 30 years in retirement.
We find that, for all spending strategies, an income\-focused asset allocation delivers similar retirement income
to the wealth\-focused allocations we study while offering better protection against market, interest rate, and
inflation risk. We also find that a glide path with an LDI portfolio offers a better tradeoff between income
growth and income risk management. Finally, our results suggest that high equity exposure in retirement is an
inadequate tool to manage longevity risk.

portfolios and enumerates their key risks so that financial advisors are better able to judge model limitations

We focus on the model risk in isolation to determine the single model class or group of models best suited
to retirement income planning from the wider set of candidates. We also look at the implementation issues
surrounding these choices. We conclude by discussing the industry and policy making implications with reference
to the UK.

Pfau, W. D. (2015a). “Choosing a Retirement Income Strategy: A New Evaluation Framework .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
130This article presents the initial stages of a new evaluation framework for choosing among retirement income
strategies. The investigation includes eight retirement income strategies: constant inflation\-adjusted withdrawal
amounts, a constant withdrawal percentage of remaining assets, a withdrawal percentage based on remaining
life expectancy, a more aggressive hybrid withdrawal percentage, inflation\-adjusted and fixed single premium
immediate annuities, a variable annuity with a guaranteed living withdrawal benefit rider, and a strategy which
annuitizes the flooring level to meet basic needs and uses the hybrid withdrawal percentage for remaining assets.
These eight strategies will be analyzed with six retirement outcome measures over a 30\-year retirement period:
the average amount whereby spending falls below the minimally acceptable level, the average spending amount,
the remaining bequest at the end of the retirement period, the minimum spending amount for any year in the
retirement period, a measure of whether spending increases or decreases over time defined as spending in the first
yeardividedbyspendinginthe30thyear,andthevalueoftotalspendingafteraccountingfordiminishingreturns
from increased spending for a client with somewhat inflexible spending needs. The model is applied to three
client scenarios representing a cross\-section of RIIA’s client segmentation matrix. It is built using Monte Carlo
simulations which reflect current market conditions, so that systematic withdrawals and guaranteed products
share compatible underlying assumptions.
Pfau, W. D. (2015b). “How to Link Retirement Strategies to Sustainable\-Spending Rates .” In:Advisor Perspectives .
\-Sustainable\-spending rates for retirement depend on many factors: asset\- and product\-allocation, market valu\-
ations at the start of retirement (particularly, current interest rates), the desired spending pattern over retire\-
ment, the degree of flexibility to adjust spending in response to market performance and the length of the client’s
planning horizon. Last week, my article introduced the Retirement Accumulation and Retirement Affordability
indices, which help clients determine if they are retiring at a good time. In this article, I will present my new
Retirement Dashboard. More specifically, I will explain the section of the dashboard on ”The Cost of Retiring
Today \- Sustainable Spending Rates for Retirement,” with these factors in mind. This analysis is conducted for
a couple who both turn 65 on January 1, 2015\. I estimated the sustainable\-spending rates for two very different
types of retirement\-income strategies: those based on dedicated\-income sources that can match client spending
needs without exposing the client to market volatility, and those based on investment portfolios in which market
volatility will play a much larger role in determining retirement sustainability.
Pfau, W. D. (2015c). “Making Sense Out of Variable Spending Strategies for Retirees .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Variable spending strategies can be situated on a continuum between two extremes: spending a constant amount
from the portfolio each year without regard for the remaining portfolio balance, and spending a fixed percentage
of the remaining portfolio balance. Variable spending strategies seek compromise between these extremes by
avoiding too many spending cuts while also protecting against the risk that spending must subsequently fall
to uncomfortably low levels. Two basic categories for variable spending rules explored include decision rule
methods and actuarial methods. Ten strategies will be compared using a consistent set of portfolio return and
fee assumptions, and using an XYZ formula to calibrate initial spending: the client willingly accepts an X percent
probabilitythatspendingfallsbelowathresholdofYdollars(ininflation\-adjustedterms)byyearZofretirement.
Presenting the distribution of spending and wealth outcomes for different strategies in which the initial spending
rate is calibrated with the XYZ formula will allow for a more meaningful comparison of strategies. The article
provides a framework for identifying appropriate spending strategies based on client preferences.
Pfau, W. D. (2018\). “An Overview of Retirement Income Planning .” In:Journal of Financial Counseling and
Planning 29(1\), pp. 114–120\.
Retirement income planning has emerged as a distinct field within financial planning with the realization that
risks change dramatically in retirement. The combination of longevity risk, increasing market risk triggered by
taking distributions from assets, and spending shocks create new challenges. Wealth management has tradi\-
tionally focused on accumulating assets without applying further thought to these differences happening after
retirement. Retirees experience reduced capacity to bear financial market risk once they have retired. This calls
for different thought processes from those typically included in traditional investment management. Risk pooling
becomes an important retirement income tool combined with a traditional investment portfolio. Retirement in\-
come challenges and a framework for helping individuals develop more efficient and successful retirement income
plans are discussed.

rate, adjust spending to portfolio performance, reduce portfolio volatility in the early retirement years, and draw
131from a buffer asset outside the portfolio to support spending when the portfolio is underperforming. We examine
the peculiarities of sequence risk using an example with U.S. market returns which leads to wealth depletion after
a thirty\-year retirement. We show how minor spending adjustments can lead to dramatically different outcomes
for remaining investment wealth at the end of the thirty\-year retirement period. We provide examples for how
each of these risk management techniques can be implemented in practice by integrating a wider range of tools
to create the potential for greater retirement efficiency in terms of supporting the retirement financial goals
with the available asset base. Examples include delaying Social Security, using annuities with lifetime spending
protections, employing a rising equity glidepath in retirement, using a time segmentation or bucketing strategy,
and creating a asset with a reverse mortgage or whole life insurance.
Pfau, W. D. and Dokken, W. (2015\). “Rethinking Retirement: Sustainable Withdrawal Rates for New Retirees in
2015\.” In:Financial Advisor Magazine .
Recent research that Dr. Wade Pfau and I have conducted finds that investors retiring as of January 1, 2015,
who pursue a traditional 4% withdrawal rate from their savings to fund retirement have a more than 50% chance
of outliving their savings. Last month in Financial Advisor, we detailed our research on safe withdrawal rates
for retirees and the findings that could disrupt the current idea about what savings can safely be generated
during a person’s retirement. Taking into account the person’s investment decisions, the real safe withdrawal
rate is much closer to 2% and could be lower. But we also believe that understanding investor behavior is key
to understanding the withdrawal figure.

Workers with defined contribution retirement plans face a daunting array of choices as they enter retirement.
They need to decide how to allocate their savings among asset classes and how much to withdraw from savings
to support retirement. They also need to make choices about when to claim Social Security and whether or
not to purchase annuities (and what type to purchase) to provide guaranteed lifetime income in addition to
Social Security. In this article, we report on a recent collaboration between the Stanford Center on Longevity
(SCL) and the Society of Actuaries (SOA) aimed at analyzing the various alternatives and finding optimal
combinations of asset and product allocations, and strategies for withdrawing funds from savings. An important
objective in this work has been finding solutions that are sufficiently straightforward to be implemented by

This paper focuses on the efficiency of allowing yield payments to dictate retirement spending, as well as the
efficiency of tilting a portfolio away from an ”efficient” portfolio for the sake of producing more yield.
Much of the literature suggests that a total return objective is a better choice than focusing on portfolio yield
for retirees. This analysis furthers this literature by revisiting the cash flow and estate objectives of a retiree.
Results suggest that (1\) using a yield portfolio forces a tradeoff between retirement spending and estate goals;
(2\) current yields may not be high enough to meet retirement income needs; (3\) yields change over time, leading
132to inconsistent spending; (4\) drawing down an efficient portfolio with the same risk as a portfolio emphasizing
yield has higher expected principal accumulation; and (5\) drawing down a portfolio is more tax\-efficient than
using yield to generate retirement income.

For various organizational reasons, large investors typically split their portfolio decision into two stages \- asset
allocation and stock selection. We hypothesise that mean\-variance models are superior to equal weighting for
asset allocation, while the reverse applies for stock selection, as estimation errors are less of a problem for
mean\-variance models when used for asset allocation than for stock selection. We confirm this hypothesis in
separate analyses of US and international equities using four different types of mean\-variance model (Bayes\-
Stein, Black\-Litterman, Bayesian diffuse prior and Markowitz), a range of parameter settings, and a simulation
analysis calibrated to US data.

Many individuals rely on annuity purchases to provide a steady stream of income during their post\-retirement

that are extremely detrimental to the purchaser in a low\-interest\-rate environment. This article develops a
methodologythatenablesretailinvestorstostructureannuitiesusingcommonlyavailableUSTreasuryexchange\-

Each period, the portfolio is rebalanced to match the modified duration of a reference annuity. This minimizes
interest rate risk from parallel shifts in future yield curves. The weights are optimized to provide the highest yield
possible. The objective is for the portfolio to provide the required periodic annuity payments and have a zero
balance at annuity maturity under a variety of interest rate scenarios, while providing the maximum possible
yield. Scenario tests show that the strategy is effective under parallel yield curve shifts, but may have shortfalls
for curve steepening and gains for curve flattening. Investors may choose to add to their initial investment to
reduce the risk of shortfalls if the curve steepens. The article concludes with an implementation of the strategy
using actual Treasury ETFs.
Pruser, J. (2021\). “Forecasting US inflation using Markov dimension switching .” In:Journal of Forecasting 40(3\),

This study considers Bayesian variable selection in the Phillips curve context by using the Bernoulli approach
of Korobilis (Journal of Applied Econometrics, 2013, 28(2\), 204\-230\). The Bernoulli model, however, is unable
to account for model change over time, which is important if the set of relevant predictors changes. To tackle
this problem, this paper extends the Bernoulli model by introducing a novel modeling approach called Markov
dimension switching (MDS). MDS allows the set of predictors to change over time. It turns out that only a small
set of predictors is relevant and that the relevant predictors exhibit a sizable degree of time variation for which
the Bernoulli approach is not able to account, stressing the importance and benefit of the MDS approach. In
addition, this paper provides empirical evidence that allowing for changing predictors over time is crucial for
forecasting inflation.

This chapter describes the challenges and opportunities that older Americans face, with a focus on retirement
income security and the role of continued work later in life. We first overview the new world of retirement income
security including a discussion of how a low return environment (e.g. low interest rates) exacerbates existing
retirement income security challenges. We then document how older people have responded to the evolving
retirement income landscape, especially when and how they exit the labor force, and we explore how continued
work later in life can help mitigate some of the anticipated retirement security challenges. We then pose some
important outstanding questions. The implications of societal aging depend in large part on how we harness or
squander the labor resources of older individuals.

Demographic and financial factors are key risk\-drivers for insurance companies and pension funds. This paper
proposes a systematic investigation for deepening our understanding how these risk drivers affect the annuity
cost. We employ local and global sensitivity methods. For local sensitivity, we derive closed form expressions
for the differential importance measures of perturbed annuities and connect them to the entropy of the annuity
cost. For global sensitivity, we compare variance\-based, moment\-independent sensitivity measures and Shapley
effects. In particular, moment\-independent sensitivity measures and Shapley effects are compared for the first
time in the case of dependent risk factors. Our framework encompasses and extends several previous results on
the sensitivity analysis of annuity models. From a methodological viewpoint, the techniques compared in this
paper can support analysts in building annuity models and in verifying the impact of risk drivers in their models.

The aim of this paper is to create a stable model of investment portfolio optimization through a high degree
of diversification and reduction of sudden changes in the allocation with monitoring of the dynamics of the
impact factor. In this sense, there is bootstrap application procedure, which, without an excessive number of
constraints involved in the optimization process provides solutions based on uncertain information. Thus defined,
the optimization method has been patented by Michaud (1999\) entitled re\-sampled efficiency. Accordingly, this
paper offers a comparison of the performance block bootstrap optimization models and traditional Markowitz’s
model inside and outside of the sample by applying the most frequently traded stocks on the BSE. The results
show a better performance out of the sample and the presence of a larger number of shares forming the portfolio
through bootstrap methodology. However, only through the traditional optimization process could be attained
optimum according to the required limits. Such effects can be observed by comparing the limits of efficiency
obtained through these optimization models. However, optimization\-based methods bootstrap finds its place in
reducing errors of assessment resulting from the limited sample size.

Individuals face many challenges when developing a retirement plan. Hurdles arise at different stages of the
retirement planning lifecycle. In the pre\-retirement period, a significant obstacle arises when individuals must
save for retirement to maximize their utility in retirement. The question of how much to save along with where
to save impacts the amount the individual has in retirement. Post\-retirement individuals must overcome the
obstacle of how to optimally withdraw from their retirement savings to mitigate sequence risk and longevity risk
to reduce the chance of portfolio failure. Individuals in post\-retirement must develop strategies that not only
mitigate these risks but also allow them to enjoy the retirement they have envisioned.

We present an approach to stress testing that is both practically implementable and solidly rooted in well\-
established financial theory. We present our results in a Bayesian\-net context, but the approach can be extended
to different settings. We show (i) how the consistency and continuity conditions are satisfied; (ii) how the result
of a scenario can be consistently cascaded from a small number of macrofinancial variables to the constituents
134of a granular portfolio; and (iii) how an approximate but robust estimate of the likelihood of a given scenario
can be estimated. This is particularly important for regulatory and capital\-adequacy applications.

Several studies have found fundamental flaws in the traditional approach to managing individual investors’

funds in either a taxable account or Roth IRA. This study recommends that an individual’s asset values be
converted to after\-tax values and the asset allocation be based on the after\-tax values. In general, within the
target asset allocation, individuals should hold bonds and other assets subject to ordinary income tax rates in
retirement accounts and hold stocks, especially passively managed stocks, in taxable accounts.
Reichenstein, W. (2020\). “Saving in Roth Accounts and Making Roth Conversions before Retirement in Today’s
Low Tax Rates .” In:Journal of Financial Planning .
There is a strong possibility that tax rates will rise in the next few years by more than the tax rate increases that
are already scheduled to occur in 2026 according to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). And, due to the taxation
of Social Security benefits and income\-based Medicare premiums, many retirees will have substantially higher
marginal tax rates in retirement than their then\-current tax brackets. As a result, many investors can expect
to have higher marginal tax rates in their retirement years than in their pre\-retirement years. This column
recommends advice financial advisers can provide this year and perhaps the next few years to help clients\-
especially pre\-retirement\-age clients\-take advantage of what my colleagues and I believe are today’s temporarily
relatively low tax rates. In the next few years, while tax rates are relatively low, pre\-retirement\-age investors
should consider: (1\) saving in tax\-exempt accounts like a Roth 401(k) instead of tax\-deferred accounts like a
401(k); and (2\) making Roth conversions to fill today’s relatively low tax brackets.
Reichenstein, W. and Meyer, W. (2016a). “Redo Strategies: When Can You Redo a Prior Social Security Claiming
Decision? ” In:Journal of Financial Planning .
Many financial planners are aware that a client has the one\-time right to withdraw his or her application for
retirement benefits if made within 12 months after benefits began. This article explains two other redo strategies
that planners may not be aware of. One strategy is the ability to suspend retirement benefits at full retirement
age (FRA) or later in order to earn delayed retirement credits, and then to reinstate suspended benefits at a later
date. The second strategy applies to disabled individuals where the disabled person begins disability benefits
before attaining FRA then suspends disability benefits at FRA in order to earn delayed retirement credits.
Prior to the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, other redo strategies were available, however changes
embedded in this Act eliminated these other strategies as of April 29, 2016\. This article discusses these recent
rule changes, explaining that there are now three sets of rules, noting which set of rules apply to individuals,
depending upon when they were born.
Reichenstein, W. and Meyer, W. (2016b). “Social security claiming strategies for widows and widowers .” In:The
Journal of Retirement 3(4\), pp. 77–86\.
This study presents rules governing survivor benefits and provides several cases to illustrate these rules. It then
presents guidelines to help financial advisors quickly determine the best strategy for a widow or widower who is
eligible for survivor benefits. The authors present separate advice for four groups of clients who differ in terms of
the age of the surviving spouse. In addition, they present examples that illustrate the logic of the recommended
strategies for each group of survivors. As seen in several examples, there are many times when a widow or
widower should not simply take the larger of his or her own retirement benefit or his or her survivor benefits.

This paper explains the options provided by the tax code for Roth conversions and recharacterizations.
Models are presented of the after\-tax value of Roth conversion strategies to the strategy of retaining funds in a
TDA and withdrawing these funds in a later year.
Four reasonable cases illustrate how the Roth conversion and recharacterization options in the tax code could
allow a taxpayer to increase the after\-tax value of the funds converted to a Roth account by 5\.56 percent,
compared to the strategy of retaining these same funds in a tax\-deferred account until later in retirement. One
particular case, in which the Roth conversion increased the after\-tax value by 62\.79 percent, reflects the situation
many taxpayers face. An example explains what a financial adviser should do to take advantage of the Roth
conversion/recharacterization options available in the tax code.
Reichenstein,W.andMeyer,W.(2018\). “UnderstandingtheTaxTorpedoandItsImplicationsforVariousRetirees .”
In:Journal of Financial Planning 31(7\), pp. 38–45\.
135The ”tax torpedo” refers to the sharp rise and then sharp fall in marginal tax rates caused by the taxation of
Social Security benefits. For many middle\-income households, this tax torpedo causes their marginal tax rate
within a wide range of income to be 150 percent or 185 percent of their tax bracket. Many middle\-income retirees
can have a federal\-alone marginal tax rate of 40\.7 percent in 2018\. If we return to the 2017 tax brackets in 2026,
as called for in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, then many middle\-income retirees will face a federal marginal tax
rate of 46\.25 percent. This paper provides income ranges in 2018 within which the tax torpedo likely will apply
for singles, qualifying widow(er)s, married couples filing separately that lived apart for the entire year, and
married couples filing jointly. Examples illustrate how singles and couples younger than age 70 may be able
to reduce the adverse effects of the tax torpedo and thus extend the longevity of their financial portfolio by
delaying Social Security benefits until 70\. This paper also explains how singles and couples already subject to
required minimum distributions may be able to reduce the adverse effects of the tax torpedo and extend the
longevity of their financial portfolio using Roth conversions.

This article explains how Medicare Part B and D premiums vary with a household Modified Adjusted Gross
Income. Each time MAGI increases by 1 above several income threshold levels, a couple Medicare premiums two
years hence can rise by more than 2,400\. These premium hikes represent spikes in the marginal tax rate exceeding
240,000 %. It then explains how certain life\-changing events can affect a household level of Medicare premiums.
Next, it presents two cases that illustrate the value that financial advisors can add to clients portfolios by helping
them coordinate a smart Social Security claiming strategy with a tax\-efficient withdrawal strategy. These cases
demonstrate that higher\-income households should consider making Roth conversions from 2019 through 2025,
when tax rates are scheduled to be temporarily lower, and before required minimum distributions begin. These
Roth conversions may allow these households to greatly reduce the size of both their lifetime income taxes and
their lifetime Medicare premiums. Finally, it explains the advantages for households with someone at least age
70\.5 of making charitable contributions through Qualified Charitable Distributions from Individual Retirement
Accounts.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made significant changes to the rules affecting Social Security benefits. Some
people think that these rule changes made it relatively easy to determine when someone should claim their Social
Security benefits. In this article, the authors explain the rule changes and provide 10 reasons why making an
optimal Social Security claiming decision is still complicated, even if we knew how long the single claimant or
each partner in a married couple will live. Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits remains a complex
decision.
Reichenstein, W. and Meyer, W. (2020\). “Investment implications of the rising and falling pattern of marginal tax
rates for retirees .” In:The Journal of Retirement 8(1\), pp. 53–64\.
This article begins by explaining how income\-based increases in Medicare premiums produce dramatic increases
in marginal tax rates for retirees with relatively high levels of income. It then explains how the taxation of Social
Security benefits causes most lower\- and middle\-income households to have marginal tax rates for a wide range
of income after Social Security benefits begin that are either 150% or 185% of their tax bracket. By combining
these two factors, the authors show that most retirees will have marginal tax rates in retirement that rise and fall
frequently and sharply as their income increases. This article then explains how this rising and falling pattern
of marginal tax rates should affect retired households withdrawal strategies from their financial portfolio, where
withdrawal strategy is defined broadly to include Roth conversions.
Reichenstein, W. and Meyer, W. (2021a). “Advice for Married Couples When One Spouse Will Die Year(s) Before
the Other Spouse .” In:Journal of Financial Planning 34(1\).
In a recent article, we explained how the taxation of Social Security benefits causes many retirees’ marginal tax
rate to be 150 percent or 185 percent of their tax bracket. We further explained that a $0\.01 increase in 2018
income above any of three income\-threshold levels can cause a married couple’s 2020 Medicare annual premiums
to increase by more than $2,540\. Each of these increases in annual premiums represents a spike in marginal tax
rates exceeding 254,000 percent. In this column, we discuss the implications of the taxation of Social Security
benefits and income\-based Medicare premiums for retired married couples filing jointly, when one spouse dies
at least one calendar year before the other spouse. Thus, this column applies to most retired married couples.

Thisstudydescribesatax\-efficientwithdrawalstrategythatcanaddsubstantialvaluetomanyclientsoffinancial
advisors with financial portfolios worth up to $2 million. In early retirement years, these households can delay
the start of their Social Security benefits and make Roth conversions to fill relatively low tax brackets, which
are generally also their marginal tax rates. Once Social Security benefits begin, they can make tax\-free Roth
withdrawals to minimize the amount of tax\-deferred account (e.g., 401(k)) withdrawals that are taxed at 185%
of their tax bracket, due to the taxation of Social Security benefits. With a series of cases, we show that a
financial advisor can add substantial value to many of their clients’ financial portfolios by recommending such
a withdrawal strategy.
Reichenstein, W. and Meyer, W. (2021c). “Social Security Claiming Strategies for Singles and Their Implications
for Couples .” In:Journal of Financial Planning 34(5\).
This report presents important insights related to the optimal Social Security claiming age for a single individ\-
ual. The first section demonstrates that in order to maximize expected real (inflation\-adjusted) lifetime Social
Security benefits, it is seldom optimal for a single retiree to claim benefits in any month near either of two
dates. The first date is 36 months prior to the full retirement age (FRA), while the second date is the FRA. The
second section discusses four other factors that the single retiree should consider when selecting their claiming
age. Each of these factors should encourage single individuals to delay claiming Social Security beyond this
lifetime maximizing age. The report then explains when the lessons from the first section related to maximizing
a single retiree’s expected real lifetime benefits also apply to the claiming strategy for each partner of a married
couple. As the reader will see, the lessons for single retirees apply to the claiming strategy for some married
couples, but not for others.

10(2\), pp. 94–97\.
The author discusses an area within the field of after\-tax asset allocation in which he and his co\-author William
Jennings disagree with the point proposed in the preceding article by Stephen Horan. But, more importantly,
the author expresses the importance of those areas in which Horan, Jennings and he, as well as other scholars,
agree. In particular, there appears to be wide agreement among scholars that, when calculating an individual’s
asset allocation, one should distinguish between pretax funds and after\-tax funds. In short, taxes matter! He
concludes with a crucial message: if it is indeed right to argue that funds in tax\-deferred or tax\-exempt portfolios
should be accounted differently than those held through fully taxable structures, then the profession is currently
miscalculating individuals’ asset allocations, and the measurement errors can be substantial.
Reilly, C. and Byrne, A. (2018\). “Investing for Retirement in a Low Returns Environment .” In:How Persistent Low
Returns Will Shape Saving and Retirement . Oxford University Press.
Low returns on financial assets and increasing longevity mean saving for retirement is becoming more challenging
than it has been in the past. Generations retiring in the near term face increased longevity but have lived through
periods with strong market returns boosting their assets, and many also have defined benefit plan entitlements.
Younger generations, who also face increasing longevity, are unlikely to earn historical investment returns on
their retirement portfolios, and few have traditional pensions. We model the likely outcomes for different cohorts
under scenarios for savings behavior, investment returns, and longevity. While younger generations do face
substantial challenges, we show that plausible courses of action involve increased contributions and delayed or
partial retirement, which can provide reasonable income replacement rates in retirement. We map out the steps
that the retirement industry (government, employers, and financial services providers) must take to support
people in following these courses of action, such as providing more flexibility over social security.
Reznik, G., Alleva, B., Song, J., Sarney, M., and Olsen, A. (2020\). Analysis of Benefit Estimates Shown in the Social
Security Statement . Tech. rep. Social Security Administration.
The Social Security Statement is one of the Social Security Administration’s (SSA’s) most important ways to
communicate with the public. Because a worker’s complete lifetime earnings are unknown at the time his or
her Statement is prepared, SSA estimates his or her future benefits by using the worker’s historical earnings to
project future earnings until retirement. Prior literature has examined the accuracy of benefit estimates shown
in the Statement; however, there have not been efforts to test the accuracy of alternative methods of estimating
retirement benefits. This paper documents a study by SSA’s Office of Retirement and Disability Policy of the
accuracy of the current Statement estimation method, the current method’s assumption that 2 years of zero
earnings predict no future earnings, and the accuracy of potential alternative methods of projecting earnings
137and benefits. Using administrative data from the Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS), the paper finds
that the Statement’s current estimation method performs as well as or better than any of the other methods
tested. The paper concludes with recommendations for the Social Security Statement.
Rietz, R., Blumenschein, T., Crough, S., and Cohen, A. (2018\). “Analyzing Retirement Withdrawal Strategies .” In:
Preprints .
An optimal withdrawal strategy beginning at age 65 provides a lifetime income from a portfolio, adjusted
annually for inflation, while reducing the probability of living in financial ruin to an ac\-ceptable level. This
paper analyzes the probability of living in financial ruin, potentially for multiple years, rather than just the
event of ruin. A stochastic Excel model was developed to simulate the effect of varying investment returns on
a portfolio with two asset classes; large company stocks and long\-term government bonds. A stochastic model
is also applied to retiree mortality. The following variables were analyzed to determine their relative impact
on withdrawal strategies: Withdrawing a constant percentage of the portfolio, Gender, Initial asset allocation,
Asset allocation rebalancing methods, and Low investment return environments. For both genders and most
withdrawal rates, an approximately equal initial asset allocation of stocks and bonds, combined with a level
rebalancing function, provided the lowest probability of living in financial ruin. Because each investment return
followed its own probability distribution function, some retirees experienced financial ruin even in the most
conservative simulations.
Rietz, R. J., Blumenschein, T., Crough, S., Cohen, A., and Coleman, J. (2020\). “A Simulation for Minimizing both
the Probability and the Length of Financial Ruin in Retirement .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Retirees worry about depleting their portfolio, but a greater concern could be how long they might live without
income from that portfolio. A retiree may accept a 4% probability of portfolio depletion, but object to the
possibility of living five or six years afterwards without that income. Thus, a retirement portfolio’s exhaustion is
not a terminal event, but rather is only the beginning of a retiree’s living in poverty. This analysis simulates not
only the event of financial ruin, but also its duration during the retiree’s remaining lifetime. This paper analyzes
withdrawing a constant percentage of the portfolio, gender, initial asset allocation, asset allocation rebalancing
methods, and low investment return environments to determine their relative impact on withdrawal strategies.

Actuarial Journal 25(sup1\), S182–S195\.
This article derives optimal consumption, investment, and annuitization patterns for retired households that
have access to German\-style participating payout life annuities (PLAs), allowing for capital market risks as
well as idiosyncratic and systematic longevity risks. PLAs provide guaranteed minimum benefits in combination
with participation in insurers’ surpluses. Minimum benefits are calculated based on conservative assumptions
regarding capital market and mortality developments, while surpluses distributed to annuitants bridge the gap
between the insurers’ actual investment and mortality experiences and the projections used in pricing. Through
the participation scheme, systematic longevity risk is shared between insurers and annuitants, as unanticipated
longevity shocks result in benefit adjustments via the surplus mechanism. We show that the retiree draws

Even if the interest rate guarantee is reduced to zero in adverse capital market environments, PLAs prove to
provide substantial utility for retirees. Overall, the participating life annuity design produces substantial welfare
gains over a no\-annuity world, while being an effective setup that helps providers manage long\-term risks that
are difficult to hedge otherwise, such as systematic longevity risks.

Prior to the financial crisis mortgage securitization models increased in sophistication as did products built
to insure against losses. Layers of complexity formed upon a foundation that could not support it and as the
foundation crumbled the housing market followed. That foundation was the Gaussian copula which failed to
correctly model failure\-time correlations of derivative securities in duress. In retirement, surveys suggest the
greatest fear is running out of money and as retirement decumulation models become increasingly sophisticated,
large financial firms and robo\-advisors may guarantee their success. Similar to an investment bank failure the
event of retirement ruin is driven by outliers and correlations in times of stress. It would be desirable to have
a foundation able to support the increased complexity before it forms however the industry currently relies
upon similar Gaussian (or lognormal) dependence structures. We propose a multivariate density model having
fixed marginals that is tractable and fits data which are skewed, heavy\-tailed, multimodal, i.e., of arbitrary
complexity allowing for a rich correlation structure. It is also ideal for stress\-testing a retirement plan by fitting
historical data seeded with black swan events. A preliminary section reviews all concepts before they are used
and fully documented C/C\+\+ source code is attached making the research self\-contained. Lastly, we take the
opportunity to challenge existing retirement finance dogma and also review some recent criticisms of retirement
ruin probabilities and their suggested replacement metrics.

reference point for asset allocations and returns assessment as a DB plan’s funded status improves. This article
discusses how the GPS provides a durable framework to support holistic and strategic DB plan management as
the sponsor’s understanding of plan liabilities deepens, how a GPS can serve to facilitate managing risks that are
important today, such as interest rate risk, and those that are expected to become more apparent in the future,
such as longevity risk, and the ways in which major risk reduction methods work in building and sustaining a
GPS over time.
Rosenthal, D. (2018\). “Joint effect of random years of longevity and mean reversion in equity returns on the safe
withdrawal rate in retirement .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Using historical data on inflation\-adjusted total equity returns (price change plus dividend) from the S\&P
500 from 1926 to 2017, this paper develops a simulation\-based model to determine the safe, inflation\-adjusted
withdrawalratefromaportfolioofassets.Themodel,namedtheRealisticRetirementSimulator(RRS),improves
upon other simulation models by directly addressing two factors that significantly affect the safe withdrawal
rate: (1\) uncertainty about the number of years of retirement, i.e., at what age will the retiree die; and (2\) mean
reversion in equity returns. RRS models the number of years in retirement as a random factor based on the
Social Security Administration 2015 Actuarial Life Table. The mean\-reverting stock return model within RRS
is statically calibrated to the 1926 to 2017 S\&P 500 data. With these two key factors addressed and assuming
future equity returns follow the historical record, RRS shows that a 65\-year\-old male retiree can withdraw 6% of
the starting portfolio balance each year from a 100% stock portfolio with a 90% success rate; a 4% withdrawal
rate is 99% successful. A simulation model that does not address these two key factors the author is not aware of
single model that addresses both factors that a 4% withdrawal rate results in a 90% success rate for a retirement
lasting 30 years. At the 90% success level, about half of the increase from 4% to 6% comes from treating the
length of the retirement as a random factor and other half comes from the mean\-reverting model. Many scenarios
are run to show how the success rate changes when RRS input assumptions are changed, e.g., age of retiree or
stock/bond mix of retiree portfolio. Of particular importance is the assumption that future equity returns will
repeat the historical record. If the future, long\-run trend for equity returns is a 4% compound annual growth
rate (CAGR) instead of the 6\.93% observed in the historical data, RRS shows that a withdrawal rate of 4% has
a success rate of 95%. Regardless of the assumption about future equity returns, directly modeling uncertainty
in the length of retirement and mean reversion in equity returns results in more accurate and higher estimates
of the safe withdrawal rates compared to models that do not directly address these factors.

In this article we offer a simplified version of the alternative retirement planning model we originally proposed
(De Villiers and Roux, 2019\). Our method focuses on determining the sustainable lifestyle level (SLL) that
an individual can currently afford while still saving enough towards retirement to sustain this lifestyle level
up to retirement and beyond. The model is simplified by assuming that the real rate of return on retirement
savings before retirement will be the same as the withdrawal rate of income from the accumulated savings during
retirement. This method yields a much simpler SLL relationship in that it is more generally applicable albeit
possibly less accurate. This approach should improve communication of the extent of the retirement savings
challenge, possibly leading to better savings outcomes.

Deferred Income Annuity? ” In:The Journal of Retirement 6(1\), pp. 8–21\.
This article analyzes a retirement strategy of delaying Social Security commencement past Social Security
retirement age to effectively increase annuity income.
Using Monte Carlo simulations for returns on a pre\-tax retirement portfolio and simplified tax, marriage, and
Social Security benefit assumptions, I compare three retirement strategies:
1\)following the 4% rule with retirement at Social Security normal commencement age (66\),
2\)delayed commencement to age 70 with forgone Social Security income replaced by portfolio withdrawals
3\)following the 4% rule with normal retirement age commencement and purchase of deferred life annuity of
equivalent expected actuarial value to the increase in Social Security that would occur if commencement
were delayed to age 70\.
Results for the scenarios analyzed generally support delaying Social Security as a preferred method to annuitize
assets over the direct purchase of a deferred annuity, particularly under the married scenario. Compared with
Strategy 1, delaying Social Security increases portfolio fail rates by year 30 (age 96\) by 10 percentage points (to
about 20%) and results in reduced portfolio values across outcomes.
The trade\-off is increased inflation\-protected income under portfolio failure scenarios by 32% of the primary
benefit.
Ruthbah, U. (2020\). “The Retirement Puzzle .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
The present\-day retirees may not be as well off as they expect to be during their retired life. Given the current
state of the world \- higher life expectancy, close to zero real interest rate and the economic turmoil caused by the
Covid\-19 pandemic, a superannuation fund as large as 545,000 USD may not be enough to support a comfortable
lifestyle. The rules of means\-tested age pension provide incentives for a broad spectrum of people to deplete their
superannuation in the early years of retirement, with significant negative consequences for government finances.
Spending at retirement does not increase proportionally with assets. For some range of superannuation balances,
the net present value of spending could increase more than the increase in assets, as the net present value of

distributional impact of the age pension is unequal across different asset levels and is regressive to some extent.

An individual’s financial risk tolerance ultimately drives his or her financial decisions and is therefore of critical
importance in personal financial planning. Two psychometrically valid measures of an individual’s financial risk
tolerance are highlighted, and academic research findings on the nine determinants of an individual’s financial
risk tolerance are discussed. For example, financial risk tolerance tended to increase with the level of the client’s
education, income and wealth, and financial knowledge and experience. Financial risk tolerance also appeared to
vary with gender, age, and market conditions. A framework was developed to organize the nine discrete factors
that influence a client’s financial risk tolerance on the basis of foreseeability and manageability to make it easier
for financial planners to integrate financial risk tolerance into the financial planning process.

Stability of preferences is central to how economists study behavior. This paper uses panel data on hypothetical
gambles over lifetime income in the Health and Retirement Study to quantify changes in risk tolerance over time
and differences across individuals. The maximum\-likelihood estimation of a correlated random effects model
utilizes information from 12,000 respondents in the 1992\-2002 HRS. The results are consistent with constant
relative risk aversion and career selection based on preferences. While risk tolerance changes with age and
macroeconomic conditions, persistent differences across individuals account for 73% of the systematic variation.

This article argues that long\-duration Treasury Inflation\-Protected Securities (TIPS) should play an important
role in the portfolios of workers who are within 10 to 20 years of retirement. Long TIPS effectively help hedge
retirees against fluctuations in the real wealth required to sustain a given level of consumption in their retirement
years. As such, long\-duration TIPS act as the ”risk\-free asset”in the context of retirement savings, and, for
investors on a reasonable savings path, an allocation to this asset class may increase the likelihood of a successful
retirement outcome.

the academic literature on normative portfolio choice. We investigate the latter claim. How much normative
advice does robo\-advice contain? For this purpose we web\-scrap portfolio recommendations for 151200 investor
types (input combinations from an online questionnaire) for one of the largest US robo\-advisors. Our results
show that the type of investment goal and the length of time horizon are dominating inputs with significant
influence on recommended equity allocations. Normative advice in the form of Merton type hedging demands
plays no role at all.

We discuss the backtesting of investment and trading strategies. We start with the challenges and pitfalls:
overfitting, data preparation, and the effects of randomness. Then, we introduce and describe R software for
backtesting. We demonstrate how to use the software for univariate and multivariate strategies (i.e. portfolio
141strategies) for two equity data sets. Specifically, we discuss the implementation and testing of momentum and
portfolio optimization models. Throughout, we stress the analysis of sensitivity and robustness checks. Since
such analyses require to run many backtests, we also discuss how backtests can be run in parallel.

comes.” In:Journal of Financial Planning .
Thispaperdemonstrateshowmovingthreechoicelevers(assetallocation,initialwithdrawalrate,andwithdrawal
flexibility) affects the joint distribution of retirement outcomes in terms of future consumption and terminal
wealth. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the joint effects of the three choices on retirement outcomes in terms of
income and terminal wealth were investigated. Results indicate that withdrawal flexibility effectively transferred
some portfolio risk from a household’s wealth to its income, and allowing for even modest withdrawal flexibility
dramatically reduced the probability of running out of money. Because retiree goals in terms of lifestyle and
legacy can be related to income and terminal wealth, a case may be made for featuring regular Monte Carlo
simulation in the retiree decision\-making process.
Šestanović, T. and Arnerić, J. (2021\). “Neural network structure identification in inflation forecasting .” In:Journal
of Forecasting 40(1\), pp. 62–79\.
Neural networks (NNs) are appropriate to use in time series analysis under conditions of unfulfilled assumptions,
i.e., non\-normality and nonlinearity. The aim of this paper is to propose means of addressing identified shortcom\-
ings with the objective of identifying the NN structure for inflation forecasting. The research is based on a
theoretical model that includes the characteristics of demand\-pull and cost\-push inflation; i.e., it uses the labor
market, financial and external factors, and lagged inflation variables. It is conducted at the aggregate level of
euro area countries from January 1999 to January 2017\. Based on the estimated 90 feedforward NNs (FNNs) and
450 Jordan NNs (JNNs), which differ in variable parameters (number of iterations, learning rate, initial weight
value intervals, number of hidden neurons, and weight value of the context unit), the mean square error (MSE),
and the Akaike Infor\- mation Criterion (AIC) are calculated for two periods: in\-the\-sample and out\- of\-sample.
Ranking NNs simultaneously on both periods according to either MSE or AIC does not lead to the selection
of the ’best’ NN because the optimal NN in\-the\-sample, based on MSE and/or AIC criteria, often has high
out\-of\- sample values of both indicators. To achieve the best compromise solution, i.e., to select an optimal NN,
the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) is used. Comparing
the optimal FNN and JNN, i.e., FNN(4,5,1\) and JNN(4,3,1\), it is concluded that under approximately equal
conditions, fewer hidden layer neurons are required in JNN than in FNN, confirming that JNN is parsimonious
compared to FNN. Moreover, JNN has a better forecasting performance than FNN.

To enable investors to spend down the assets in their defined contribution accounts more easily, the authors
propose a decumulation benchmark comprising a laddered portfolio of TIPS for the first 20 years (consuming 88
percent of available capital) and a deferred life annuity purchased with the remaining 12 percent. This portfolio
can be used directly by the investor (akin to indexing) or as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of a
more aggressive strategy.

This paper introduces a portfolio construction framework for risk\-averse investors that aim to meet or exceed a

(RCPC) presents a risk\-optimized alternative to Target Date Funds (TDFs). Risk Capacity Portfolio Construc\-

Targeted Return Portfolio Construction (Sherwood, 2019\) and is detailed within this paper in its application to

Shi, Y. (2021\). “Forecasting Mortality Rates with the Adaptive Spatial Temporal Autoregressive Model .” In:Journal
of Forecasting 40(3\), pp. 528–546\.
Accurate forecasts of mortality rates are essential to various demographic research like population projection,
and the pricing of insurance products such as pensions and annuities. Recent studies have considered a spatial\-
temporal autoregressive (STAR) model for the mortality surface, where mortality rates of each age depend on
the historical values of itself (temporarily) and the neighboring cohorts ages (spatiality). This model has sound
statistical properties including co\-integrated dependent variables and existence of closed\-form solutions. Despite
its improved forecasting performance over the famous Lee\-Carter (LC) model, the constraint that only the effects
of the same and neighboring cohorts are significant can be too restrictive. In this study, we adopt a data\-driven
adaptive weighted structure and propose the adaptive STAR (ASTAR) model. Retaining all desirable features
of the STAR, our model uniformly outperforms the LC and STAR counterparties for forecasting accuracy, when
mortalitydataaged 0–100of theUnited Kingdom, France,Italy,Spain andJapan over1950–2016are considered.
Two sensitivity tests and additional simulation results also lead to robust conclusions. The proposed ASTAR
model is therefore a widely useful tool in modelling and forecasting mortality rates in other contents, and may
be extensible to multi\-population modelling.

e\-Print, pp. 121–144\.
Social Security benefits may be commenced at any time between age 62 and age 70\. As individuals who claim
later can, on average, expect to receive benefits for a shorter period, an actuarial adjustment is made to the
monthly benefit amount to reflect the age at which benefits are claimed. We investigate the actuarial fairness of
this adjustment. Our simulations suggest that delaying is actuarially advantageous for a large subset of people,
143particularly for real interest rates of 3\.5 percent or below. The gains from delaying are greater at lower interest
rates, for married couples relative to singles, for single women relative to single men, and for two\-earner couples
relative to one\-earner couples. In a two\-earner couple, the gains from deferring the primary earner’s benefit are
greater than the gains from deferring the secondary earner’s benefit. We then use panel data from the Health
and Retirement Study to investigate whether individuals’ actual claiming behavior appears to be influenced by
the degree of actuarial advantage to delaying. We find no evidence of a consistent relationship between claiming
behavior and factors that influence the actuarial advantage of delay, including gender and marital status, interest
rates, subjective discount rates, or subjective assessments of life expectancy.

This paper derives optimal asset allocations (which assets to hold) and asset locations (in which accounts to
hold them) for a risk\-averse investor saving for retirement. The investor can hold taxable corporate bonds,
tax\-exempt municipal bonds, and stocks either in a tax\-deferred or a conventional taxable savings account.
Taxable bonds have a preferred location in the tax\-deferred account and tax\-exempt bonds have a preferred
location in the taxable account for investors in sufficiently high tax brackets. Tax\-efficient stock portfolios (e.g.
passively\-managed mutual funds) should be held in the taxable account and tax\-inefficient stock portfolios
(e.g. actively\-managed mutual funds) should be held in the tax\-deferred account. We show that locating assets
optimally can significantly improve the risk\-adjusted performance of retirement saving.

This article presents a thorough evaluation of target date funds (TDFs) for the period 2010\-2020\. TDFs have
grown enormously in assets, reaching USD1\.4 trillion at the end of 2019, and account for approximately 24% of
all assets in 401(k) accounts. We report on the results of a style analysis evaluation of TDFs that determines their
effective asset allocation. It examines both the constant in the style analysis regressions and resulting Sharpe
ratios, which reflect the over\- or under\-performance of the funds relative to a passive benchmark with the same
asset allocation. Lower cost TDFs tend to match the benchmark returns, while higher cost TDFs deviate from
them considerably. We examine how TDFs performed in the stock market crash between February 19 and March
23, 2020, during which five\-week period broad market averages fell by about one\-third. We find that the value
of long\-dated TDFs (those with a target date of 2045 and beyond) fell by between 30% and 35%, while the 2025
funds, designed for people roughly 60 years old, lost between 20% and 25% of their value. We find that past
performance only weakly influences future expected performance. As with equity funds in general in this period,
TDFs with actively managed ingredient funds, on average, trailed the performance of their cheaper passively
managed counterparts.

in the Retirement Stage of the Life Cycle .” In:The Journal of Retirement 5(3\), pp. 73–92\.
The uncertainty in life expectancy plays a critical role in individual financial planning. Its impact is magnified
during the retirement years (the wealth distribution stage of the life cycle), as new sources of income typically
are not available to retired persons. Utilizing a multi\-stage stochastic program, the authors model and solve the
optimal asset allocation problem of a retired couple with uncertain life expectancy in the presence of a term life
insurance policy. In the base case, they find optimal policies assuming no longevity risk (i.e., lifetime scenarios
are uncertain although life expectancy is fixed on the retirement date). Next, they introduce longevity risk in
the scenario generation stage through either a shift in the expected lifetimes or an unexpected cut in periodic
retirement income. The authors find that the optimal asset allocation policy depends on the presence and the
type of these risks as well as the relative price of insurance and the size of any cut in pension benefits.

implications of these findings for practitioners and other stakeholders.
Smith, G. and Gould, D. P. (2007\). “Measuring and controlling shortfall risk in retirement .” In:The Journal of
Investing 16(1\), pp. 82–95\.
A key challenge for retired investors is determining the stock\-bond asset allocation that, for a given spending
rate, provides an acceptable probability of shortfall – having real wealth drop below a specified floor during the
investor’s lifetime. Standard portfolio analysis yields the well known tradeoff between risk and return described
by the Markowitz frontier. For retirement planning, we reconceptualize this as a tradeoff between shortfall
probability (risk) and the median value of terminal wealth (return). For specified assumptions, there is a stock\-
bond asset allocation that minimizes shortfall risk. Portfolios with more stocks increase the median values of
terminal wealth, but at the expense of higher shortfall risk. Portfolios with fewer stocks are inferior in that they
decrease the median value of terminal wealth and increase shortfall risk. We find that for a variety of plausible
assumptions about asset returns, investment strategies, and what constitutes a shortfall, the minimum\-risk
portfolio generally has between 50 and 70% stocks.

Sneddon, T., Bao, C., and Zhu, Z. (2015\). “Optimal Asset Liability Management for Post\-retirement stage with
Income Protection Product .” In:21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation .
Australia has a compulsory defined contribution retirement provision system, whereby employers must con\-
tribute a proportion of the pre\-tax salary of their employees towards an individual account which cannot be
accessed until retirement except in extraordinary circumstances. These funds are generally invested in a port\-
folio of financial assets from which the retiree may draw throughout retirement. Retirees under this system face
two key problems when making investment and withdrawal decisions regarding this portfolio. Firstly, retirees
must manage their superannuation investment portfolio to maximise their riskadjusted returns and thereby best
financially provide for their own retirement. Secondly, retirees must optimise their withdrawal pattern from the
superannuation account throughout retirement so as to maximise their post\-retirement lifetime utility given
the need to minimise the risk of portfolio ruin prior to death. We model this issue as a dynamic stochastic
optimisation problem with constraints. The market value of the portfolio is a function of the annual contri\-
butions invested by the individual throughout their career and the returns derived from their investment in
uncertain financial markets. The post\-retirement lifetime utility function is a function of discounted annual in\-
come throughout retirement and is therefore subject to market and inflation risk. We model the financial market
uncertainties as correlated stochastic processes as projected by a variant on the Wilkie stochastic investment
model developed within CSIRO, the SUPA (Simulation of Uncertainty for Pension Analysis) model. We also
define an income protection asset (an inflation index linked annuity) which is available to the individual as a
tool to hedge inflation risk. We then solve the dynamic superannuation/pension portfolio optimisation problem
using a numerical approach that is based on the stochastic control algorithm to calculate the conditional value
functions of investors for a sequence of discrete decision dates. The algorithm provides optimal decisions for
portfolio asset allocation in financial markets and the optimal amount to shift towards the annuity product on
an annual basis to achieve maximum post\-retirement lifetime utility whilst minimising the risk of portfolio ruin
prior to death.
Sneddon, T., Zhu, Z., and O’Hare, C. (2016\). “Modelling defined contribution retirement outcomes: A stochastic
approach using Australia as a case study .” In:Australian Journal of Actuarial Practice 4, pp. 5–19\.
In this paper we present a stochastic forecast model in a defined contribution pension system for projecting
the accumulation and decumulation phases from an individual fund perspective. We use the Australian super\-
annuation system as the context to demonstrate this ”SUPA”(Simulation of Uncertainty for Pension Analysis)
model. The SUPA model can be used to simulate the evolution of superannuation fund balances across time
during the accumulation and decumulation phases. The model comprises four elements: (1\) a stochastic projec\-
tion of investment returns; (2\) a stochastic projection of income levels (upon which contributions to the fund
are based); (3\) a projection of levels of withdrawal in retirement; and (4\) a stochastic projection of increasing
longevity (life table). The combination of these four elements within the SUPA model is described in detail
in this paper. One application of the model is demonstrated through a case study involving recent Australian
145legislative amendments. In this example, we show how the model can be used to forecast likely outcomes (i.e.
whether individuals will have sufficient funds in retirement), under the current superannuation structure and a
previous structure. This will demonstrate how the SUPA model can be used to model the potential impact of
any changes to a superannuation system.

Sornwanee, M. (2020\). “Multi\-Regime, Goal\-Based Retirement Solutions: Sensitivity Analysis and Post\-Retirement
Performance Comparison of Dynamic Strategies .” MA thesis. Princeton University.
The shift from defined\-benefit to defined\-contribution pension plans worldwide has left many individuals who
lack access to private banking services without proper retirement financial planning. As individuals have more
responsibilities for their retirement planning, there is a growing concern of choosing asset allocation strategies
that are not suitable for their goals. Besides, in the light of the current situation regarding the COVID\-19 pan\-
demic, individuals must be able to prepare for a possible prolonged ”crash” economic regime. Understanding the
impact of such a crash regime is important for individuals to make optimal financial decisions. These aspects will
be considered in the paper. The objective of this study is to model and comprehend a fully automated retirement
planning system for individual investors. By understanding the characteristics of each strategy through various
risk measures and analyzing its sensitivity to prolonged crash economic regimes, health risks, savings rate, and
replacementincome ratio (spending after retirement,divided bythe lastsalary before retirement),wecan use the
results to recommend the most appropriate asset allocation and savings rate strategy for an individual investor.
In this study, we implement multi\-regime Monte Carlo simulations to simulate asset returns throughout the
accumulation phase (pre\-retirement) and decumulation phase (post\-retirement). We consider different asset al\-
locationstrategies:standardglidepath(SGP:linearlyreduceequityweightovertime),reversedglidepath(RGP:
linearly increase equity weight over time), ”Catch\-Up” strategy (CGP: follow SGP and increase equity weight
when the wealth falls behind a benchmark portfolio, called ”goal portfolio”), ”Play\-Safe” strategy (PGP: follow
SGP and decrease equity weight when the wealth exceeds the goal portfolio), and ”Dynamic Zone” glide path
(DGP: combine CGP and PGP). We analyze the performances concerning non\-goal\-based and goal\-based risk
measures while incorporating the longevity risk and its corresponding risk measures, such as the probability of
outliving retirement savings, to further comprehend the characteristics of each policy. We evaluate a goal\-based,
dynamic strategy that alters the savings rate based on its performance relative to the goal portfolio. That is, it
increases the savings rate during a crash regime and decreases the savings rate during a normal regime. More\-
over, we conduct sensitivity analyses on 4 parameters: prolonged crash economic regime, health risks, savings
rate, and replacement income ratio. The results are analyzed to fully comprehend the strengths and weaknesses
of each strategy. First, we recommend PGP for individual investors, especially when there is a prolonged crash
regime. Generally, it outperforms other strategies in average maximum drawdown ratio, Goal\-at\-Risk (GaR),
Conditional Goal\-at\-Risk (CGaR), and the probability of outliving retirement savings. If a 10\-year crash regime
starts after the middle of the pre\-retirement phase, PGP best protects the portfolio from a huge loss during the
crisis as it has the lowest probability of outliving retirement savings, which is 18 percentage points lower than
that of SGP. With PGP, individuals need to increase their savings rate by 8\-31 percentage points, depending on
the timing of a 10\-year crash regime, to narrow the probability of outliving savings to 10%. However, it is less
effective to increase the savings rate only during the crisis or to decrease the replacement income ratio. Besides,
for any allocation strategy, the worst time to have a prolonged crash regime is in the middle of the pre\-retirement
phase, leading to an increase of 69 percentage points in the probability of outliving savings. In terms of savings
rate, shifting more savings to an earlier part in the pre\-retirement phase can result in a reduction in both the
average maximum drawdown and the probability of outliving retirement savings for CGP, PGP, and DGP. Also,
the result of the goal\-based, dynamic savings rate strategy, in terms of the probability of outliving savings, is
equivalent to that of increasing the savings rate for the entire pre\-retirement period by 12%.

The preservation and transfer of wealth to future generations are among the central financial goals for most
high\-net\-worth families. Using a stylized theoretical model and Monte Carlo simulations, this article quantifies

than a family oblivious to taxes. More important, the article demonstrates that a significant value accrues from
integrating income tax efficiency and estate tax planning: Becoming efficient with respect to one tax should
make the family even more eager to become efficient with respect to the other.

benefits.” In:Insurance: Mathematics and Economics 64, pp. 246–258\.
Variable annuities with guaranteed minimum lifetime withdrawal benefits (VA/GLWB) offer retirees longevity
protection, exposure to equity markets, and access to flexible withdrawals in emergencies. We model how risk\-
averse retirees optimally withdraw from the products, balancing returns and the embedded longevity protection.
Assuming reasonable individual preferences, the resulting cash flow generates a Money’s Worth Ratio of around
0\.9 for our stylized VA/GLWB in the post\-crisis product, considerably lower than what was offered prior to
2008\. Sensitivity analyses with respect to portfolio choice, mortality, fees, and guaranteed withdrawal rates
show that MWRs range from 0\.80 to 1\.0, with the portfolio choice making the biggest difference. For most
parameter choices, the utility value of the VA/GLWB exceeds that of a similar mutual fund, but it is less than
for a fixed annuity. Interestingly, VA/GLWB withdrawals in early retirement can optimally exceed contract
maximum withdrawals, despite the fact that this reduces future withdrawal guarantees.

The authors investigate the biases in the backtested performance of ”alternative beta”strategies using a unique
sample of 215 trading strategies developed and promoted by global investment banks. Their results lend support
to the cautions in the recent literature regarding backtest overfitting and lack of robustness in trading strategy
performance during the ”live”period (out of sample). The authors report a median 73 percent deterioration
in Sharpe ratios between backtested and live performance periods for the strategies, and they establish a link
between performance deterioration and strategy complexity, with the realized reduction in live versus back\-
tested Sharpe ratios of the most complex strategies exceeding those of the simplest ones by over 30 percentage
points. The robustness of strategy exposure to risk factors varies between asset classes and strategies; it appears
reasonable in equity volatility and FX carry strategies but quite weak in the equity value strategy in particular.

We developed a retirement financial planning strategy based on Markov chain modeling of retirement health

are modeled as basic expenses plus discretionary expenses. Our goal is to solve for the maximum discretionary
expenseswhilehealthy,whichwasobtainedusingaclosed\-formsolutionandquantileoptimizationtechnique.The
highlight of this model is the use of Kalman Filter for annual recalibration. It allows the model to automatically
adjust the suggested amount of discretionary expenses by looking at daily fund values from previous year. After
running a lot of simulations and testings, we showed that our dynamic model beats other static models and a
naive recalibration model in the sense that it virtually eliminates ruin and is able to let a retiree withdraw the
largest possible amount.

A considerable literature examines the optimal decumulation of financial wealth in retirement. We extend this
research to incorporate housing, which comprises the majority of most households’ non\-pension wealth.We esti\-
mate the relationship between the returns on housing, stocks, and bonds, and simulate a variety of decumulation
strategies incorporating reverse mortgages. We show that homeowner’s reversionary interest, the amount that
can be borrowed through a reverse mortgage, is a surprisingly risky asset. Under our baseline assumptions,
we find that the average household would be as much as 24 percent better off taking a reverse mortgage as a
lifetime income relative to what appears to be the most common strategy: delaying tapping housing wealth until
financial wealth is exhausted and then taking a line of credit. In addition, we show that housing wealth displaces
bonds in optimal portfolios, making the low rate of participation in the stock market even more of a puzzle.

Annuitiesareperceivedasilliquidfinancialsecurities.Longpositionsinannuitiescanbeoffsetusinglifeinsurance

improve the efficiency of the annuities market. Annuities are perceived as being illiquid financial instruments,
and this has limited their attractiveness to consumers and their inclusion in financial models. However, short
positions in annuities can be replicated using life insurance and debt, permitting long positions in annuities to be
offset, or short annuity positions to be created. The implications of this result for the annuity puzzle, arbitrage
between the annuity and life insurance markets, and speculation on expected longevity are investigated. It is
argued that annuity replication could help reduce the annuity puzzle, improve the price efficiency of annuity

Evaluating an investor’s ability, willingness and need to take risk, and then designing his or her portfolio
accordingly, are the most crucial functions of investment/financial planning and the ”fintech” software that
supports the profession. Thus, the ability to estimate an investor’s financial risk tolerance (FRT) is key to the
success of a financial plan. Financial advisors know that psychological factors, such as financial anxiety, financial
satisfaction (the knowledge that one has ”enough”), obsession with money, personality type, self\-esteem and
sensation\-seeking behavior, are all important contributors in determining an investor’s FRT \- the willingness to
accept financial risk.

about it? ” In:Quantitative Finance 21(11\), pp. 1855–1868\.
It is widely noted that market capitalisation weighted portfolios are inefficient and underperform an equal
weighted portfolio over the long\-term. However, at least since 2016, an equal weighted portfolio of stocks in
the S\&P500 has significantly underperformed the market capitalisation weighted portfolio. In this paper, we
analyse this underperformance using stochastic portfolio theory. We show that the equal weighted portfolio
does appear to outperform the market capitalisation weighted portfolio over the long\-term but with periods of
significant short\-term underperformance. In addition, we find that concentration in the market capitalisation
weighted portfolio has increased in recent years and has contributed to the recent underperformance together
with a significantly lower level of diversification benefits. Furthermore, we highlight an approach to improve the
performance of a portfolio by dynamically selecting a market cap or an equal weighting using a rudimentary
linear regression model.

The decisions of asset selection and allocation lie at the heart of financial portfolio management. For these
challenging tasks, the mathematical programming model of the mean\-variance optimization problem proposes
to use the concept of diversification. The novel methodology in this article is a representation of the accumulated
knowledge of this model from the modern portfolio theory. It is a practical application for portfolio managers
to help synthesize the available historical data and to infer rational decisions. The state\-of\-the\-art backtesting
methodology integrates the unsupervised machine learning method of clustering analysis into the mean\-variance
portfolio optimization model. The test results from the proposed novel methodology show that clustering with
Euclidean distance measures outperform the results of the benchmark and other specified clustering methods
for different datasets, backtesting periods, and temporal scales of major stock indices.

Research indicates that financial risk tolerance (FRT) is a subjective and complex phenomenon and may diverge
from individual to individual based on their demographics, genetic makeup, socioeconomic profiles, personality
types, and psychological constructs. Past researchers have mainly focused on relating the socioeconomic profile,
demographics, and personality type of investors to FRT. This article uses a novel approach that relates other
critical behavioral and psychological factors, such as financial anxiety, financial satisfaction, obsession with
money, personality type, self\-esteem, and sensation\-seeking behavior, as equally important contributors for
determining the FRT. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used to
test the variables and hypotheses. The results show that financial satisfaction is negatively correlated with FRT,
whereas financial anxiety, obsession with money, personality type, self\-esteem, and sensation\-seeking behavior
are positively correlated with FRT. All these variables act as antecedents of FRT.

Retirement 5(3\), pp. 109–120\.
Analyses of savings rates needed for succcessful retirement rates (SSRs) typically assume constant real earnings
growth throughout one’s career. However, data on the life\-cycle earnings patterns of millions of U.S. workers
suggest that earnings growth does not occur at a constant rate that matches inflation. Instead, earnings tend
to increase at a decreasing rate during the early years of one’s career and decrease at an increasing rate in
the later years. Utilizing simulations of saving and dissaving throughout the life cycle based on both historical
market returns and forecasted returns, the authors examine the impact of assuming more realistic earnings
growth relative to constant inflation\-adjusted growth. Results indicate that failing to account for more realistic
earnings curves throughout the life cycle may overstate SSRs for lower\-income households while understating
SSRsforhigher\-incomehouseholds,andunderstateSSRsforyoungerhouseholdswhileoverstatingSSRsforolder
households. Furthermore, historical SSRs of 10% or less are found for all but the highest\-income households after

may exist based on the simulation methods utilized.
Thompson, J. R., Feng, L., Reesor, R. M., Grace, C., and Metzler, A. (2021\). “Measuring Financial Advice: Aligning
Client Elicited and Revealed Risk .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Financial advisors use questionnaires and discussions with clients to determine a suitable portfolio of assets that
will allow clients to reach their investment objectives. Financial institutions assign risk ratings to each security
they offer, and those ratings are used to guide clients and advisors to choose an investment portfolio risk that
suits their stated risk tolerance. This paper compares client Know Your Client (KYC) profile risk allocations
to their investment portfolio risk selections using a value\-at\-risk discrepancy methodology. Value\-at\-risk is used
to measure elicited and revealed risk to show whether clients are over\-risked or under\-risked, changes in KYC
risk lead to changes in portfolio configuration, and cash flow affects a client’s portfolio risk. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of value\-at\-risk at measuring clients’ elicited and revealed risk on a dataset provided by a private
Canadian financial dealership of over 50,000 accounts for over 27,000 clients and 300 advisors. By measuring
both elicited and revealed risk using the same measure, we can determine how well a client’s portfolio aligns
with their stated goals. We believe that using value\-at\-risk to measure client risk provides valuable insight to
advisors to ensure that their practice is KYC compliant, to better tailor their client portfolios to stated goals,
149communicate advice to clients to either align their portfolios to stated goals or refresh their goals, and to monitor
changes to the clients’ risk positions across their practice.

disclosure to improve retirement plan choices .” In:Journal of Banking \& Finance 121, p. 105955\.
Standardized information disclosures aim to help people compare complex financial products and make bet\-
ter choices. We investigate the extent to which information shown in a regulator\-mandated dashboard helps
retirement savers choose between alternative pension plans. We conduct incentivized experiments that collect
participants’ repeated choices between two pension plans using the mandatory dashboard, and subsequently test
whether an even simpler dashboard improves choices, and by how much. Participants switch quickly from a high\-
to a low\-fee pension plan when they see explicit nominal fees but are significantly more confused by percentage
fees and adjust slower. When differences between plan performance arise from gross returns, not fees, we find
that complex information formats can seriously hinder participants’ recognition and reactions. We present a
Bayesian updating model which estimates the relative noisiness of the signals from fees and gross returns across
different treatments and use this model to show how better information presentation raises retirement savings.
Tian, W. and Zhu, Z. (2020\). “Optimal Investing after Retirement Under Time\-Varying Risk Capacity Constraint .”
In:arXiv e\-Print .
This paper explores an optimal investing problem for a retiree facing longevity risk and living standard risk.
We formulate the optimal investing problem as an optimal portfolio choice problem under a time\-varying risk
capacity constraint. Under the specific condition on model parameters, we show that the value function is a
C\*C solution of the HJB equation and derive the optimal investment strategy in terms of second\-order ordinary
differential equations. The optimal portfolio is nearly neutral to the stock market movement if the portfolio’s
value is at a sufficiently high level; but, if the portfolio is not worth enough to sustain the retirement spending,
the retiree actively invests in the stock market for the higher expected return. In addition, we solve an optimal
portfolio choice problem under a leverage constraint and show that the optimal portfolio would lose significantly
in stressed markets. This paper shows that the time\-varying risk capacity constraint has important implications
for asset allocation in retirement.

Both the level and the sequence of investment returns will have a big impact on retirement outcomes. Poor
returns during the early years of retirement are bad news. However, the particular withdrawal strategy used
affects sequence risk, and an approach where withdrawals are variable and respond to portfolio performance can
improve retirement outcomes. I’ll examine the evidence and then use my own modeling to show how a strategy
that combines variable withdrawals with partial annuitization using a single\-premium immediate annuity (SPIA)
maximizes the cash available for consumption.

retirement withdrawals. Spoiler alert \- as the title hints, 75/25 versus 60/40 doesn’t matter that much.

The article primary contribution is applying a dynamic decision theory approach to investment management
and adding spending flexibility to improve incomes for retirees for whom saving more and working longer are
no longer options. We investigate whether a self\-driving portfolio, engineered to protect against market risk,
can deliver more income than other investment approaches while minimizing the risk of ruin. We consider
whether a dynamic strategy, based on a stochastically dominant decision theory algorithm and tested with fixed
and variable spending policies, can minimize the chance of running out of money before dying. Outcomes are
compared with a number of static approaches. We find that the dynamic strategy provides an average of 51%
more income than a target date fund through retirement when combined with a hybrid spending rule over a
relevant probability of ruin range of 1% through 25%. Furthermore, when rebalanced to constant risk rather
than to fixed asset mixes, sequence of return risk can be reduced. Variable spending policies add effectiveness
and should be considered regardless of investment strategy. Importantly, dynamic decision theory establishes a
framework for goal\-seeking solutions that may have application in other phases of the investor life cycle.

Statistical clustering is a procedure of classifying a set of objects such that objects in the same class (called clus\-

in any other classes. In this paper, we apply four clustering approaches to improving forecasting performances of
the Lee\-Carter and CBD models. First, each of four clustering methods (Ward’s hierarchical clustering, divisive
hierarchical clustering, K\-means clustering, and Gaussian mixture model clustering) is adopted to determine,
based on some characteristics of mortality rates, the number and partition of age clusters from the whole study
ages 25\-84\. Next, we forecast 10\-year and 20\-year mortality rates for each of the age clusters using the Lee\-Carter
and CBD models, respectively. Finally, numerical illustrations are given with two R packages ”NbClust” and
”mclust” for clustering. Mortality data for both genders of the US and the UK are obtained from the Human
Mortality Database, and the MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) measure is adopted to evaluate forecasting
performance. Comparisons of MAPE values are made with and without clustering, which demonstrate that all
the proposed clustering methods can improve forecasting performances of the Lee\-Carter and CBD models.

Taxes play an important role in determining after\-tax investment risk and returns, but many practitioners still
make investment decisions based on pre\-tax values. The apparent complexity of dealing with deferred capital
gains and the question of how these implied future tax liabilities should be valued are central to this problem.
The authors use a simple arbitrage argument to show that a risk\-free discount rate is appropriate for calculating
the present value of future tax liabilities. This lets analysts adjust risk and returns for effective tax rates and
present a more accurate picture to the investor. The results show a taxation\-induced preference for holding
equities over bonds and a location preference for holding equities in a taxable account and bonds in retirement
accounts. These important findings contrast with traditional investment advice that suggests a greater capacity
for risk in retirement accounts.

multiple methods to evaluate evidence .” In:Behaviormetrika 46(1\), pp. 121–144\.
Null hypothesis significance testing is cited as a threat to validity and reproducibility. While many individuals
suggest that we focus on altering the p value at which we deem an effect significant, we believe this suggestion
is short\-sighted. Alternative procedures (i.e., Bayesian analyses and observation\-oriented modeling: OOM) can
be more powerful and meaningful to our discipline. However, these methodologies are less frequently utilized
and are rarely discussed in combination with NHST. Herein, we discuss three methodologies (NHST, Bayesian
Model comparison, and OOM), then compare the possible interpretations of three analyses (ANOVA, Bayes
Factor, and an Ordinal Pattern Analysis) in various data environments using a frequentist simulation study.
151We found that changing significance thresholds had little effect on conclusions. Furthermore, we suggest that
evaluating multiple estimates as evidence of an effect allows for more robust and nuanced interpretations of
results and implies the need to redefine evidentiary value and reporting practices. Recent events in psychological
sciencehavepromptedconcernswithinthedisciplineregardingresearchpracticesandultimately,thevalidityand
reproducibility of published reports (Etz and Vandekerckhove 2016; Lindsay 2015, Open Science Collaboration
2015; van Elk et al. 2015\). One often discussed matter is over\-reliance, abuse, and potential hacking of p values
produced by frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), as well as misinterpretations of NHST
results (Gigerenzer 2004; Ioannidis 2005; Simmons et al. 2011\). We agree with these concerns and believe that
many before us have voiced sound, generally accepted opinions on potential remedies, such as an increased focus
on effect sizes (Cumming 2008; Lakens 2013; Maxwell et al. 2015; Nosek et al. 2012\). However, other suggestions
have been met with less enthusiasm, including an article by Benjamin et al. (2018\) advocating that researchers
should begin thinking only of p values less than .005 as ”statistically significant”, thus changing alpha levels
to control Type I error rates. Alternatively, Pericchi and Pereira (2016\) promote the use of fluctuating alpha
levels as a function of sample size to assist with these errors. Trafimow et al. (2018\) critiques this suggestion to
broadly lower the alpha level to .005 and suggested that findings should be weighted on the basis of evidence
accumulation from multiple studies. We argue that alpha should not be the sole focus of our attention, but
rather, we should wonder if a p value should be utilized at all, and, if so, what that p value can tell us
in relation with other indicators. While NHST and p values may have merit, researchers have a wealth of
other statistical tools available to them. We believe that improvements may be made to the sciences as a
whole when individuals become aware of these tools and how these methods may be used, either alone or in
combination, to strengthen understanding of data and conclusions. These sentiments have been shared by the
American Statistical Association who recently held a conference focusing on going beyond NHST, expanding
their previous stance on p values (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016\). Therefore, the main goal of this project was
to show researchers how two alternative paradigms compare to NHST in terms of their methodological design,
statistical interpretations, and comparative robustness. Herein, we will discuss the following methodologies:
NHST, Bayes factor comparisons, and observation\-oriented modeling. To compare their methodological designs,
we first provide historical backgrounds, procedural steps, and limitations for each paradigm. We then simulated
data using a three timepoint repeated measures design with a Likert\-type scale as the outcome variable to be
able to compare the statistical interpretations and comparative robustness. By simulating possible data sets
and analyzing them with each of the three paradigms, we will be able to discuss the conclusions these three
methods reach given the same data and to compare how often these methodologies agree within different data
environments (i.e., given varying sample sizes and effect sizes). Beyond simply comparing methodologies, we also
sought to identify how changing the alpha criteria within the NHST framework may alter conclusions. Although
previous work has already compared Frequentist NHST to Bayesian approaches (Goodman 1999; Rouder et
al. 2012; Wetzels et al. 2011\), this manuscript adds a novel contribution: observation\-oriented modeling. By
introducing social scientists to observation\-oriented modeling (OOM), a relatively new paradigm that is readily
interpretable, we will show both how useful this paradigm can be in these contexts, and how it compares to two
well\-known methods. We hope that by discussing these methodologies in terms of a simple statistical analysis
researchers will be able to easily compare and contrast methodologies.

investment approach versus consumption approach .” In:Journal of Pension Economics and Finance 19(2\),
pp. 262–291\.
This paper models the decumulation period of a Personal Pension with Risk sharing (PPR). We derive several
relationships between the contract parameters. Individuals can adopt two approaches to the decumulation period
of a PPR: the investment approach and the consumption approach. In the investment approach, individuals
specify how to invest wealth and how much wealth to withdraw. Retirement consumption follows endogenously.
In the consumption approach, in contrast, individuals specify retirement consumption exogenously. Investment
and withdrawal policies follow endogenously. We explore these two approaches in detail. Consistent with habit
formation, we allow for excess smoothness and excess sensitivity in retirement consumption.

This paper introduces a class of unit\-linked annuities that extends existing annuities by allowing portfolio
shocks to be gradually absorbed into the annuity payouts. Consequently, our new class enables insurers to offer
an affordable and adequate annuity with a stable payout stream. We show how to price and adequately hedge
152the annuity payouts in a general financial environment. In particular, our model accounts for various stylized
facts of stock returns such as asymmetry and heavy\-tailedness. Furthermore, the generality of our framework
makes it possible to explore the impact of a parameter misspecification on the annuity price and the hedging
performance.

Allocation: A Downside Risk Perspective .” In:Journal of Investment Management 14(2\).
Despite its clear importance, there is no consensus on the optimal asset allocation strategy for retirement
investors of varying age, gender, and risk tolerance. This study analyzes the allocation question by focusing on
the downside risks that result from the joint uncertainty over investment returns and life expectancy. Using a
new analytical approach, we show that concentrating on the severity of retirement funding shortfalls, rather than
just the probability of ruin, markedly increases the sustainability of a retirement portfolio. We demonstrate that
for retirement investors attempting to minimize downside risk while sustaining future withdrawals, appropriate
equity allocations range between five and 25 percent, levels that are strikingly low compared to those typically
found in life\-cycle funds. Further, these optimal portfolio constructions appear to vary little with alternative
capital market assumptions.We also show that more aggressive investors having substantial bequest motives
should still be relatively conservative in their stock allocations. We conclude that the higher equity allocations
commonly employed in practice significantly underestimate the risks that these higher\-volatility portfolios pose
to the sustainability of retirement savings and incomes.
Van Harlow, W. (2014\). Optimal Asset Allocation in Retirement: A Downside Risk Perspective . Tech. rep. Putnam
Institute.
Once an individual has retired, asset allocation becomes a critical investment decision. Unfortunately, there is
no consensus on what the optimal allocation should be for retirees of varying age, gender and risk tolerance.
This study analyzes the allocation question through a focus on the downside risks created by uncertainty
over investment returns and life expectancy. We find that the range of appropriate equity asset allocations in
retirement is strikingly low compared with those of typical lifecycle and retirement funds now in the marketplace.
In fact, for retirement portfolios whose primary goal is to minimize the risk of depletion and sustain withdrawals,
optimalequityallocationsrangebetween5percentand25percent.Thisquiteconservativelevelofequityholdings
changes little even when we significantly change our assumptions on capital market returns. We even find that
more aggressive equity allocations, those that still retain some focus on depletion risk but also seek to provide
substantial bequests to heirs, are also relatively conservative. The study suggests, in short, that the higher
equity allocations used in many popular retirement investment products today significantly underestimate the
risks that these higher\-volatility portfolios pose to the sustainability of retirees’ savings and to the incomes on
which retirees depend.

hedging can increase the income generated by retirement savings by almost 40 percent. Thus, downside hedging
strategies within retirement portfolios appear to offer attractive benefits to retirees worried about outliving their

Van Harlow, W. and Brown, K. C. (2017\). “Health State and the Savings Required for a Sustainable Retirement .”
In:The Journal of Retirement 4(4\), pp. 25–38\.
Life expectancy varies greatly with health conditions, but very rarely is this relationship incorporated into
retirement investment planning. This is surprising given that the vast majority of older households have one
or more adverse health conditions. The authors show that the savings required to fund a successful retirement
for someone with one of several diseases whose impact on life expectancy has been estimated can be reduced
by as much as 26 percent for females and 33 percent for males relative to the savings required for a healthy
individual. Similarly, the savings required to fund healthcare expenses in retirement can be reduced by 29
percent to 39 percent. The interaction of projected health costs and the effect of disease on life expectancy have
counterintuitive effects on retirement planning. For example, the higher retiree healthcare expenses associated
153with conditions such as diabetes and tobacco use are offset by reduced life expectancies. The net effect is that, in
certain health states, less savings are required for healthcare than would be necessary for a healthy individual.

Offering professional advice around the retirement planning process represents an important component of the
financial services industry. The authors examine the demographic, investment, and behavioral characteristics
of individuals who obtain this advice as well as the economic value that it ultimately adds. Using a survey
of more than 4,000 working households, they find that wealth and income levels are positively correlated with
the decision to engage a professional advisor, as are factors such as marital status, age, and education level. To
assess the value added by this advice, the authors develop a unique metric of retirement income replacement that
incorporateshealth\-basedlifeexpectancyandhousehold\-specificfinancialcircumstances.Theapproachestimates
the percentage of annual pre\-retirement income that a household will be able to spend each year in retirement.
The authors establish the unconditional finding that advised households generate significantly larger proportions
of post\-employment spending (both gross and net of Social Security benefits) than do nonadvised households.
Controlling for additional explanatory factors, we find that an advisor adds more than 15 percentage points
of income replacement in retirement. These findings support the conclusion that obtaining and implementing
financial advice in the retirement planning process leads to a demonstrable increase in the level of sustainable
retirement spending.

attitude match the model prediction even when selecting investors with the same classical risk profile. The study
should motivate to define investor profiles based on two coordinates rather than just one, meaning a combination
of risk and latitude vis\-a\-vis losses. Such behavioral investor profiles improve customer centricity, contribute to
a long\-term relationship and simply increase the likelihood of right\-selling individual products.
Vanguard Research (2020\). Dynamic spending: A better way to budget in retirement . Tech. rep. Vanguard.
Financial markets are unpredictable – they can bring tremendous gains one day and post painful declines the
next. If you’re close to retirement or already retired, this can pose a significant concern – but it doesn’t have to.
Investors use a number of methods to figure out how much they can spend in retirement, but one, in particular,
stands out: a dynamic spending approach. Dynamic means it’s flexible – by making minor changes to your
spending in any given year in response to the markets’ performance, you can help sustain your portfolio during
market downturns (while sacrificing little) and have more to spend following high\-performing years.

Multiple testing of a single hypothesis and testing multiple hypotheses are usually done in terms of p\-values.
In this paper we replace p\-values with their natural competitor, e\-values, which are closely related to betting,
Bayes factors, and likelihood ratios. We demonstrate that e\-values are often mathematically more tractable; in
particular, in multiple testing of a single hypothesis, e\-values can be merged simply by averaging them. This
allows us to develop efficient procedures using e\-values for testing multiple hypotheses.

The Journal of Retirement 2(2\), pp. 55–66\.
Investors commonly fund their retirement through portfolios of stocks and bonds or mutual funds, which offer
scant protection against the risk of a market downturn or of outliving their wealth. This article examines how
adding a variable annuity with a guarantee lifetime withdrawal benefit (VA \+ GLWB) to a balanced portfolio
can help reduce the risk of running out of money in retirement. It quantifies, through simulation analysis, the
degree to which an allocation to a VA \+ GLWB can help mitigate two key retirement risks: longevity and
sequence of returns risk. This risk reduction comes at the cost of a decrease in the expected future bequest.
The article also explores how the timing of withdrawals and the asset allocation within a VA \+ GLWB impacts
retirement outcomes.

The conventional wisdom dictates that you should take distributions from your portfolio first and only from
home equity as a backup. But including home equity as part of the portfolio can greatly increase the probability
of maintaining constant purchasing power throughout retirement.

As global interest rates hover near historic lows, defined benefit pension plan sponsors must grapple with the
prospect of lower investment returns. We examine three levers that can enhance portfolio outcomes in a low\-
return world: increased contributions; reduced investment costs; and increased portfolio risk. We use portfolio

Increased risk can deliver a significant impact, but with the least certainty.

The bear market of October 9, 2007 March 9, 2009, was the worst in U.S. history since the Great Depression.
During this period, U.S. stocks lost about 58 percent of their value in just 16 months. Because of declining real
estate prices, foreclosures, and the large amount of mortgage\-backed assets held by banks, the amount of bank
credit available to business firms was sharply reduced, creating a serious liquidity shortage. The authors test
the hypothesis that technical insolvency and bankruptcy risks were significant determinants of stock returns in
the October 9, 2007 March 9, 2009 bear market. They also test several hypotheses related to the effects of beta,
firm size, market\-to\-book ratio, and volatility on stock returns in bear markets and stock market crashes.

155In our experience, many investment professionals don articulate risk well to clients. This research uniquely and
graphically reveals the nature of strategic asset allocation investment risk not only for single\-period investors,
but also for multi\-period investors such as those whose savings are held for retirement. Using Monte Carlo
simulations, we evaluate and picture the nature of that multi\-period consumption risk with spending rules that
are subject to a budget constraint and those that aren (such as the 4% rule). Risk in a multi\-period context
means that realized spending may increase with greater SAA risk, but it may instead be worse.

SSRN e\-Print .
Utility functions can assist in designing a menu of investment options by encoding the objectives and preferences
for various investor types with the aim of developing suitably tailored products. This paper demonstrates the
process through the construction of an illustrative menu of Australian MyRetirement products. The demonstra\-
tion shows how utility\-based analysis can be combined with more traditional metrics to compare strategies and
convey their implications; and provides direction on how product options might be presented to a retiring mem\-
ber. Central to the process is characterizing investor types by selected attributes. This both facilitates specifying
utility functions for use in product development, and supports communication based around the type of investor
for which a product is designed along with its key features and the outcomes it may deliver. Utility functions thus
provide the mechanics that drive the analysis, without becoming an explicit component of investor engagement.
Warshawsky, M. (2018\). “Reforming Retirement Income: Annuitization, Combination Strategies, and Required
Minimum Distributions .” In:SSRN e\-Print .
Laddered immediate life annuity purchase and asset withdrawal combination strategies represent an excellent
way for retirees to manage their retirement assets in order to get lifetime income in a flexible manner while still
maintaining growth, liquidity, and bequest potentials. Simulations show that even by age 95, a retiree using this
strategy will get higher income, in inflation\-adjusted terms, on average and across most scenarios than by using
full and complete annuitization or just using the common 4 percent withdrawal rule. Moreover, a significant
fund balance remains to the retiree throughout life, on average, but with no risk of running out of assets. The
minimum distribution requirements that govern tax\-qualified retirement accounts for older retirees should be
reformed to encourage the use of these partial annuitization combination strategies. This broad reform of the
required minimum distribution rules needs to be done for the same reason the Obama administration made a
narrow exception to the required minimum distribution rules for longevity insurance to achieve the reasonable
public policy goal of encouraging the use of partial annuitization by retirees.
Weber, E. U. and Klement, J. (2018\). “Risk tolerance and circumstances .” In:CFA Institute Research Foundation
Briefs4(2\).
An investor risk attitude is a stable characteristic, like a personality trait, but risk\-taking behavior can change
based on the investor age, recent market events, and life experiences. These factors change investors perceptions
of the risks. Differences in risk tolerance between men and women or in different circumstances trace back
to emotional as much as rational considerations. Financial advisers should consider all of these factors when
advising clients and can use four simple steps to incorporate best practices: be aware, educate, nudge, and
hand hold. The term risk tolerance is defined and used in different ways. Whether risk tolerance is a stable
characteristic of a given investor or also takes into account external circumstances (e.g., economic shocks or the
domain of the decision) depends on how it is defined and measured. This brief focuses on a definition of risk
tolerance prevalent in the practitioner community, an investor willingness to take perceived risk or the trade\-off
an investor is willing to make between the perceived risk and expected return of different investment choices.
This definition derives from a psychological interpretation of the risk\-return framework of classical portfolio
theory. It treats risk tolerance as an attitude toward risk and decouples this pure attitudinal variable from the
perceptions of risks and returns variables in their own right and distinct from the expected value and variance of
the distribution of possible outcomes. Defined in this way, risk tolerance may differ among investors as a function
of socioeconomic and biological differences but (with the exception of a brief boost during adolescence) shows
stability across an investor lifespan, financial shocks, and other circumstances. Risk tolerance, in this sense, is the
mediator that translates perceptions of risk and situational needs and constraints into decision and action. The
variables that change with market conditions and other circumstances are investors perceptions of investment
risks and expectations of return. In contrast to risk tolerance, which attaches to an individual and her biological
makeup and personality, these variables change over time in response to changing external conditions. Therefore,
an investor risk\-taking behavior (as revealed by her investment decisions) can look like it has changed, despite
the stability in her risk tolerance. Perceived risks and expected returns are influenced by hopes and fears as
156much as by past returns and rational expectations and thus need to be assessed in their own right and possibly
corrected. Managing investor emotions through the ups and downs of financial markets is arguably a financial
adviser most important task. Calm times provide an opportunity to discuss and formulate an investment policy
for each client that can be consulted when emotions are running high. Managing risk perceptions requires the
financial adviser to act more like a therapist than a mechanic. It is above all about managing expectations and
emotions and helping clients to better deal with emotions when it comes to financial decisions. The end result
of this process might be a portfolio that is not in the sense of modern portfolio theory, with its assumption
of econs, but rather a portfolio that the human need for investments that can be handled in the presence of
changing emotions and changing risk perceptions.
Wiafe, O. (2015\). “Investment strategies in retirees’ decumulation phase .” PhD thesis. Queensland University of
Technology.
This thesis consists of three studies on investment strategies for Australian retirees. Specifically, it investigates
retirees’ preference between alternative drawdown strategies in the presence of government pensions, appropriate
management of longevity risk through the use of deferred annuities and asset allocation in retirement. It finds
drawdown strategies linked to life expectancy to be the best performers. Deferred annuities are found to improve
retirement incomes for risk averse retirees. For retirees who want to meet certain wealth thresholds in retirement,
equity dominated portfolios provide superior outcomes for higher threshold levels.

levels, a strategy with an all equity allocation becomes dominant. The lifecycle portfolio is dominated by the
”reverse lifecycle” portfolio at all threshold levels. Finally, for retirees who defer annuitisation, we find strategies
with a higher equity component have greater likelihood of outperforming an immediate annuitisation strategy
in terms of generating a guaranteed income late in retirement.

and Out\-of\-Sample Performance on a Large Cohort of Trading Algorithms .” In:The Journal of Investing 25(3\),
pp. 69–80\.
When automated trading strategies are developed and evaluated using backtests on historical pricing data, there
exists a tendency to overfit to the past. Using a unique dataset of 888 algorithmic trading strategies developed
and backtested on the Quantopian platform, with at least six months of out\-of\-sample performance, this ar\-
ticle studies the prevalence and impact of backtest overfitting. Specifically, the authors find that commonly
reported backtest evaluation metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, offer little value in predicting out\-of\-sample
performance (R2 \< 0\.025\). In contrast, higher\-order moments, such as volatility and maximum drawdown, as
well as portfolio construction features (e.g., hedging), show significant predictive value of relevance to quanti\-
tative finance practitioners. Moreover, in line with prior theoretical considerations, the authors find empirical
evidence of overfitting\-the more backtesting a quant has done for a strategy, the larger the discrepancy be\-
tween backtest and out\-of\-sample performance. Finally, they show that by training nonlinear, machine\-learning
classifiers on a variety of features that describe backtest behavior, out\-of\-sample performance can be predicted
with much greater accuracy (R2 \= 0\.17\) on hold\-out data than when using linear, univariate features. A port\-
folio constructed by using predictions on hold\-out data performed significantly better out\-of\-sample than one
constructed from algorithms with the highest backtest Sharpe ratios.

Inflation has been below the Federal Reserve’s target for much of the past 20 years, creating worries that inflation
may be deanchoring from the FOMC’s target. This paper uses a factor model that incorporates information
from professional forecasters, household and business surveys, and the market for Treasury inflation protected
securities (TIPS) to estimate long\-run inflation expectations. These have fallen notably in the past few years
(to roughly 1\.9 percent for CPI inflation, well below the FOMC’s target). It appears that, even before the covid
recession, the private sector viewed the economy as likely to suffer from persistent headwinds to inflation.

and the proposal of further models. These generalizations can offer efficient decumulation schemes with high
longevity protection which is particularly well adapted for retirement needs\-both for its members and carriers. In
this paper, we revisit the mechanism proposed by Fullmer and Sabin (Journal of Accounting and Finance, 2019\.
)\-which allows the pooling of Modern Tontines through a self\-insured community. This ”Tontine” generalization
retains the flexibility of an individual design: open contribution for a heterogeneous population, individualized
asset allocation and predesigned annuitization plan. The actuarial fairness is achieved by allocating the deceased

and discussed (the ”Term Dilemma”). Some solutions are then proposed to overcome scheme shortcomings and
some requirements for practical implementation are discussed.

Wolfe, B. and Brazier, R. (2018\). Spending retirement assets ... or not? Tech. rep. BlackRock.
Something unexpected has been the shared experience for our most recent generation of retirees. The vast
majority haven’t been spending their retirement savings \- leaving nest eggs mostly untouched and living on
158ready sources of income instead. However, future retirees may be less fortunate.
While on the surface this is indeed good news \- and appears to support the argument that fears of a future
retirement crisis are overstated, the conditions that supported this spending and savings behavior are unlikely to
persist. Future retirees will face a much different retirement landscape and will need to adopt new sets of skills
– behavioral and financial – that will help them systematically tap into retirement savings to support future
spending.
Financial industry norms and academic theories have always assumed assets accumulated for retirement would
besystematicallywithdrawn\-followingthe”4%rule”orsomeotherruleofthumborsystem\-byretireesinorder
to maintain a consistent standard of living. Technically, this is referred to as ”consumption smoothing” whereby
individuals seek to have consistent spending on par with pre\-retirement levels. With concerns that retirement
savings for individuals may be dangerously low,1 the fear has been that withdrawals for such smoothing could
leave retirees running out of funds well short of their passing away.
This research conducted by the BlackRock Retirement Institute (BRI) in conjunction with the Employee Benefit
Research Institute (EBRI) found that on average across all wealth levels, most current retirees still have 80% of
their pre\-retirement savings after almost two decades in retirement.
This is significant because:
•These findings begin to challenge industry norms and academic theories about lifecycle consumption espe\-
cially during the retirement phase
•Across all wealth levels measured, more than one third of current retirees grew their assets – leaving
considerable potential consumption on the table
•Late in life out\-of\-pocketmedical expenses – a major reason to retain assets – do not appear to be warranted
except for a very small portion of the population
•The financial landscape for future retirees will most likely be more challenging, requiring different savings
and spending behaviors
This paper sets to lay the foundation for how retirees have managed their sources of cash– assets and income–
against their spending behaviors. The resulting ”husbanding” of assets over the past two decades may be due
to a host of favorable environmental factors current retirees benefited from during their working, accumulation
years. These included beneficial changes to Social Security and Medicare, a relatively high percentage of jobs
that offered defined benefit pensions, strong real estate appreciation and an investment market that generally
delivered strong returns and high interest rates.
Has the confluence of these factors created a situation whereby retirees may not have felt the pressure to draw
downprincipalfromretirementsavingsinordertomaintainareasonablestandardofliving?Perhapsretireeshad
other plans for their assets beyond themselves – bequests or charitable donations come to mind. Possibly they
would have preferred to spend more freely but lacked the financial confidence or tools to efficiently decumulate
their assets or were worried about end\-of\-life healthcare expenses? Looking further, perhaps there were strong
emotional biases at play – with fear of outliving retirement assets at the top of the list.
Methodology
The objective of the study was to analyze the ”how” and some possible ”whys” spending and liquid assets change
during retirement, taking into account (non\-housing) assets, income, spending, out\-of\-pocket medical expenses
and bequests. Data was collected from the bi\-annual Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 1992\-2014\) and the
Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS, 2005\-2015\). A sample of 7,148 retiree households provided
self\-reported asset data and out\-of\-pocket medical expenditure and a subsample of 1,660 households provided
the household expenditure data. Retirees were segmented into three groups based on pre\-retirement non\-housing
retirement assets – $0 to less than $200,000 (lowest wealth), $200,000 to less than $500,000 (medium wealth)
and $500,000 and above (highest wealth).

inter\-temporal restrictions in a defined contribution pension plan .” In:Journal of Industrial \& Management
Optimization 16(6\), pp. 2857–2890\.
This paper studies a multi\-period portfolio selection problem during the post\-retirement phase of a defined con\-
tribution pension plan. The retiree is allowed to defer the purchase of the annuity until the time of compulsory
annuitization. A series of investment targets over time are set, and restrictions on the inter\-temporal expected
values of the portfolio are considered. We aim to minimize the accumulated variances from the time of retirement
to the time of compulsory annuitization. Using the Lagrange multiplier technique and dynamic programming,
we study in detail the existence of the optimal strategy and derive its closed\-form expression. For comparison
purposes, the explicit solution of the classical target\-based model is also provided. The properties of the optimal
investment strategy, the probabilities of achieving a worse or better pension at the time of compulsory annu\-
itization and the bankruptcy probability are compared in detail under two models. The comparison shows that
our model can greatly decrease the probability of achieving a worse pension at the compulsory time and can
significantly increase the probability of achieving a better pension.

Review4(4\).
This paper surveys the literature on the relationship between health and household portfolio allocation and
provides updated empirical analysis based on recent data. Prior research finds robust evidence for cross\-sectional
correlations between measures of health status and portfolio decisions, but establishing the causal pathways and
underlying mechanisms has proven more difficult and complex. Analysis from the most recently available 2016
and 2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study yields results that are consistent with existing literature.
Households with worse self\-reported health have a lower probability of holding various types of financial assets
and invest a higher share of their portfolios in safe assets, relative to other asset categories. However, there is
only weak evidence that new health shocks to a household change portfolio holdings. The paper concludes with
a discussion of the implications of this research and directions for future work.

This article examines the relationship between the riskiness of the portfolios of 401(k) plan participants, as
gauged by the total risk, global beta, total equity, and U.S. and foreign equity exposures of their portfolios, and
the participant age, gender, approach to investment, and whether he or she participates in a pension plan. The
author finds evidence not only of behavioral biases affecting the investment decisions of investors with brokerage
accounts, but also of two new apparent behavioral biases. First, participants with a defined\-benefit pension plan
do not take more risk, other things being equal, than participants without such a plan. Second, young active
participants (participants who have made an active choice of their investments) take less risk compared with
young passive participants, while older active participants take more risk than older passive participants.
Xu, G. (2018\). “Static and Dynamic Tax Diversification of Withdrawals from Multiple Individual Retirement
Accounts .” In:The Journal of Retirement 6(2\), pp. 75–87\.
160This article shows why diversified simultaneous retirement funding drawn from accounts with differing tax
treatments will save more on taxes than sequential withdrawal. We utilize dynamic programming to quantify the
optimal funding under the assumption that the goal is to maximize the total discounted after\-tax consumption
and bequest amounts. The dynamic programming setting uses the actual tax schedule, considers the required
minimum distribution and life expectancy, and constrains consumption with upper and lower bounds. We also
find the optimal funding through static diversification, a simple optimization schema. We compare the static
and full dynamic programming solutions in two cases, one for a single filer and another for a married joint filer.
The static and the full dynamic programming solution differ more in the single filer case than in the married
joint filer case. The static optimal withdrawal is close to sequential withdrawal. The full dynamic programming
optimal withdrawal is close the sequential withdrawal when both types of accounts have a substantial balance.
Xu, G. and Anichini, T. (2016\). “Mean\-Variance Analysis in Post\-Retirement Planning .” In:The Journal of Retire\-

In this study we analyze the variability and average level ofspending in retirement under two strategies: the
popular 4 percent rule and what we will term the self\-funded variable annuity strategy (SVA strategy). The 4
percent rule stipulates that each year a retiree should spend 4 percent of her initial wealthat retirement; the value
ofspendinggrowswiththerateofinflation.UndertheSVAstrategy,eachyeartheretireedeterminesherspending
level as equivalent to the income she could theoretically obtain by purchasing an annuity(but without actually
purchasing one). The 4 percent rule entailslower average spending and little variability, while theSVA strategy
entails higher average spending and highervariability. The SVA strategy is based on a theoretical foundation of
expected utility maximization. We demonstrate how a retiree can make an informed decision about allocating
among stocks, bonds, and annuities, and whether to combine the 4 percent spending rule with the SVA strategy
to achieve higher average spending. In particular, if future returns turnout to be lower than historical returns,
as many experts predict,combining the 4 percent rule and SVA strategy may achieve spending of more than 4
percent of initial wealth on average while reducing the failure rate to less than 10 percent. We also conside rhow
mortality might affect a mixed strategy that combinesa purchased annuity with the SVA strategy.

The article studies the portfolio selection problem in the retirement phase by using the habit formation utility
function in the context of traditional utility maximization. The habit formation utility can be further simplified
to a linear combination of shortfall risk and shortfall duration. A retiree who can easily adapt to a new spending
level should emphasize shortfall duration whereas a retiree who is rigid in spending should emphasize shortfall
risk. The article provides the conditions in which current practitioners favorite choices of shortfall risk, as a
criterion to choose retirement portfolios, are consistent with utility maximization.

In:The Journal of Retirement 5(4\), pp. 9–24\.
Retirees, pension funds, and the insurance industry have all been negatively affected by the wrongful estimation
of longevity. The inaccuracies in current life expectancy (LE) reports primarily result from misinterpretations
of the influence of resilience factors on longevity. This study examines different and more accurate measurement
metrics to minimize the risks related to biased LE calculations. By using both qualitative and quantitative
research approaches, this research develops a new conceptual model: a two\-factor\-LE\-analysis model with a
telomere test as a medical basis (physiological factors) and a big data approach to filter the psychological factors
to longevity. The authors suggest that the new model, together with the insights of the existing LE\-projection
methodologies, has considerable potential to improve LE predictions.
Yang, B. (2017\). “Longevity and statistical modelling .” PhD thesis. Nanyang Technological University Singapore.
This dissertation consists of two studies on the modelling aspects of mortality (or longevity). In the first paper,
we examine cohort extensions of the Poisson common factor model for modelling mortality of both genders
jointly. Several alternatives are specified and applied to datasets from five developed regions. We find that direct
parameterisation of cohort effect could improve model fitting, reduce the need for additional period factors,
and produce consistent mortality forecasts for females and males. Furthermore, we find that the cohort effect
appears to be gender indifferent for the populations examined and has an interaction effect with age in certain
cases. The second paper explores the prediction error in mortality projection. This is important given the
increasing longevity risk and the rising demand for longevity\-linked products. Insofar, only parameter error
and process error have been considered jointly while the issue of model error has been little studied. Here,
we propose a method to account for process error, parameter error and model error in an integrated manner
161by modifying the semi\-parametric bootstrapping technique. We apply the method to two datasets from the
Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) and use the simulated scenarios to price the q\-forward contracts with
a risk\-neutral approach. We find that model selection has a significant impact on the valuation results and thus
it is crucial to incorporate model error in mortality projection. The third part of the dissertation surveys the
current landscape of the longevity market and discusses some open issues related to the pricing of longevity
products in the context of the broader literature.
Yoon, Y. (2010\). “Glide path and dynamic asset allocation of target date funds .” In:Journal of Asset Management
11(5\), pp. 346–360\.
The glide path of typical target date funds is based on the relatively simple assumption of risk. If an explicit
term structure of risk is present or risk is time\-varying, the conventional glide path may not be adequate to fulfil
the purpose of target date funds. We introduce a new approach to define the glide path of target date funds.
Our starting point is to determine the level of risk budget for each target date. According to the pre\-defined risk
budget, we derive the asset allocation of target date funds by explicitly incorporating the current term structure
of risk. As risk does change through different market phases, we implement a dynamic asset allocation strategy
for target date funds that considers simultaneously both the pre\-defined risk budget and the prevailing market
risks. The main difference is that at any given time our risk\-controlled dynamically rebalanced target date funds
would not exceed the pre\-defined risk budget regardless of market movements.
Young, R. (2020a). Tax\-Efficient Withdrawal Strategies . Tech. rep. T. Rowe Price.
There are alternatives to the conventional strategy of drawing on a taxable account first, followed by tax\-deferred
and then Roth accounts. Many people can take advantage of income in a low tax bracket or tax\-free capital
gains. If planning to leave an estate to heirs, consider which assets will ultimately maximize the after\-tax value.
Young, R. (2020b). “The Roth/Pretax Decision in Late Career Years: The Increasing Importance of Accumulated
Assets in Light of the SECURE Act .” In:Journal of Financial Planning 33(12\), pp. 59–68\.
A late\-career worker with a choice between pretax and Roth retirement contributions should consider the level
of tax\-deferred assets already accumulated. That asset level affects the worker’s tax rates over the course of
retirement, due to required minimum distributions (which may not be needed to support spending), and also
affects taxes on beneficiaries. This study analyzes the decision for a variety of scenarios by calculating breakeven
asset levels (as a multiple of income) where Roth and pretax contribution strategies yield the same after\-tax
value for beneficiaries. Contrary to the conventional view that people in peak earning years should save using
pretax contributions, the analysis shows that many people who are well on track for retirement would help their
beneficiaries\-without sacrificing retirement spending\-by choosing the Roth strategy. The SECURE Act, passed
in late 2019, requires most non\-spouse beneficiaries of retirement accounts to withdraw all of the funds within
10 calendar years. That requirement can increase beneficiaries’ tax rates, compared with a ”stretch” strategy
allowable under prior law. This study shows that breakeven asset levels are significantly lower after passage of
the SECURE Act, indicating that more people would benefit from a Roth strategy now. Among the scenarios
evaluated were different beneficiary characteristics, which showed that beneficiaries’ future incomes and tax
situations can significantly affect the breakeven asset levels.

for investors. In this thesis we study classical portfolio optimization, robust portfolio optimization and some
historical black swan events. We compare two main strategies: mean variance optimization vs robust portfolio
optimization on two types of black swan events: natural vs anthropogenic. The comparison illustrates that
robust portfolio optimization is much more conservative, and has a shorter recovery time than classical portfolio
optimization. Moreover, the losses in the stock investment resulted from a natural disaster are very minor
compared to the losses resulted from an anthropogenic market crash.

Inverse Optimization with Applications on Mutual Funds .” In:arXiv e\-Print .
The fundamental principle in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is based on the quantification of the portfolio’s
risk related to performance. Although MPT has made huge impacts on the investment world and prompted
the success and prevalence of passive investing, it still has shortcomings in real\-world applications. One of
the main challenges is that the level of risk an investor can endure, known as risk\-preference , is a subjective
162choice that is tightly related to psychology and behavioral science in decision making. This paper presents a
novel approach of measuring risk preference from existing portfolios using inverse optimization on the mean\-
variance portfolio allocation framework. Our approach allows the learner to continuously estimate real\-time risk
preferences using concurrent observed portfolios and market price data. We demonstrate our methods on real
market data that consists of 20 years of asset pricing and 10 years of mutual fund portfolio holdings. Moreover,
the quantified risk preference parameters are validated with two well\-known risk measurements currently applied
in the field. The proposed methods could lead to practical and fruitful innovations in automated/personalized
portfolio management, such as Robo\-advising, to augment financial advisors’ decision intelligence in a long\-term
investment horizon.

on Sample Reweighting and Feature Selection for Financial Data Analysis .” In:IEEE International Conference
on Data Mining (ICDM) . IEEE.
Modern machine learning models (such as deep neural networks and boosting decision tree models) have become
increasingly popular in financial market prediction, due to their superior capacity to extract complex non\-linear
patterns. However, since financial datasets have very low signal\-to\-noise ratio and are non\-stationary, complex
models are often very prone to overfitting and suffer from instability issues. Moreover, as various machine
learning and data mining tools become more widely used in quantitative trading, many trading firms have been
producinganincreasingnumberoffeatures(akafactors).Therefore,howtoautomaticallyselecteffectivefeatures
becomes an imminent problem. To address these issues, we propose DoubleEnsemble, an ensemble framework
leveraging learning trajectory based sample reweighting and shuffling based feature selection. Specifically, we
identify the key samples based on the training dynamics on each sample and elicit key features based on
the ablation impact of each feature via shuffling. Our model is applicable to a wide range of base models,
capable of extracting complex patterns, while mitigating the overfitting and instability issues for financial market
prediction. We conduct extensive experiments, including price prediction for cryptocurrencies and stock trading,
using both DNN and gradient boosting decision tree as base models. Our experiment results demonstrate that
DoubleEnsemble achieves a superior performance compared with several baseline methods.

Models.” In:arXiv e\-Print .
Information coefficient (IC) is a widely used metric for measuring investment managers’ skills in selecting stocks.
However, its adequacy and effectiveness for evaluating stock selection models has not been clearly understood,
as IC from a realistic stock selection model can hardly be materially different from zero and is often accompanies
with high volatility. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of IC as a performance measure of stick selection
models. Through simulation and simple statistical modeling, we examine the IC behavior both statically and
dynamically. The examination helps us propose two practical procedures that one may use for IC\-based ongoing
performance monitoring of stock selection models.
Zhang, S. (2018\). “Optimal Retirement Planning: Scenario Generation, Preferences, and Objectives .” PhD thesis.
University of Waterloo.
The global trend of shifting from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) workplace pension plans is
putting growing pressure on individuals to take more ownership in retirement planning and financial decision\-
163making. The essence of the DB is the life\-long income guarantee, which requires limited financial planning
decisions to be made, either in the accumulation or decumulation phase. The DC on the other hand, is sig\-
nificantly more complex. The lump sum payment at retirement burdens individuals with the task of income
generation, in the presence of challenges stemming from an uncertain future lifetime, economic conditions, and
evolving consumption needs. The average retiree has limited competency to navigate these challenges, due to
low financial literacy, lack of willpower, or deteriorating cognitive abilities with older ages. The high stake of
these challenges calls for a normative solution to be proposed \- a solution that considers the intricacy of risks,
preferences, and normative objective formulations. The objective of this thesis is to explore such a solution.
This thesis comprises three inter\-related research directions: long\-term economic scenario generators (ESGs),
recursive preferences in life\-cycle portfolio selection, and retirement objective formulation. A brief description
of the subsequent chapters will now follow. The first chapter conducts a review of Wilkie’s ESG, with analysis
restricted to series pertinent to retirement planning. Our main findings indicate that there exist challenges in
modelling long\-term economic series due to the presence of multiple structural shifts in the historical time series.
Consequently, certain assumptions of stationarity are violated, and parameters are sensitive to the calibration
period. A backtest based on 30\-year out\-of\-sample data indicated that over that period the model had tended to
overestimate inflation, underestimate total return on stocks, and performed relatively well for long\-term interest
rates. Additionally, Wilkie’s ESG can be under\-representative of the risk in long\-term stock investment, partic\-
ularly in the tails. The second chapter provides an introductory discussion of Epstein\-Zin preferences, which are
adopted in the succeeding chapter as a normative preference model. The purpose is to first investigate the im\-
plied optimal behaviour and its plausibility. We pay particular attention to whether the output leads to plausible
behaviour given the context of retirement planning. Specifically, analytical solutions for a simple consumption
problem are derived, isolating the impact of relative risk aversion (RRA), elasticity of intertemporal substitu\-
tion (EIS), time discounting, and risks stemming from mortality, investment, and inflation. We investigate three
Epstein\-Zin models employed in the literature, which differ in their treatment of mortality risk, and find that
some lead to normatively implausible solutions. Importantly, we find that the EIS is not always monotone in its
effect on consumption volatility over time, meaning that its interpretation can be ambiguous when considering
an uncertain future lifetime. This has been misinterpreted in the literature to date. We also show that one partic\-
ular Epstein\-Zin specification is not necessarily a generalization of expected utility maximization under constant
relative risk aversion, as many works wrongly claim. The third chapter investigates the normative validity of
the optimal consumption and investment strategies of a discrete\-time Epstein\-Zin utility maximizing DC retiree
who wishes to benefit from stock investment, longevity insurance, and inflation protection. A comparison of
three Epstein\-Zin specifications is conducted. We use a combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria to
evaluate the adequacy of the optimal consumption profile, with special attention paid to the downside risk at
extreme old ages. We find that it remains optimal to fully annuitize, but agents with high relative risk aversion
hold precautionary savings, the level of which is impacted by the EIS and the preference specification. As dis\-
cussed in the preceding chapter, the interpretation of EIS on consumption volatility is found to be ambiguous.
Investigations of the optimal consumption profile reveal that agents are exposed to relatively high levels of down\-
side risk in the long run. This is partially attributed to a time discounting factor less than 1, which implicitly
(and contradictorily) assumes myopia in normative decision\-making. An investigation of zero time discounting
is conducted, with downside risk found be to significantly reduced in the long run. The fourth chapter focuses on
retirement objective formulation. This chapter is motivated by the unsatisfactory normative solutions found in
the preceding chapter under mathematically convenient objective functions. In order to develop more actionable
prescriptive solutions, we seek to holistically explore actual retirement decision\-making. To this end, we con\-
duct a survey study of 1,000 Canadian (pre\-)retirees age 50 to 80, on topics of retirement consumption, wealth,
income, risk perception, decision making, and planning objectives. Additionally, we investigate the descriptive
validity of the expected lifetime discounted utility maximization framework in predicting optimal planning be\-
haviours. Overall, there is overwhelming evidence of heterogeneity in wealth, income, concerns, and objectives.
We find a prevalence of low retirement assets, a severe underestimation of survival probabilities to an extreme
old age of 95, and a strong aversion toward life annuities. Pre\-retirees appear to have reasonable expectations
regarding income and assets in retirement, with the median retiree relying heavily on public pension sources.
(Pre\-)retirees are primarily concerned with liquidity needs, consumption smoothing, inflation, and longevity in
retirement, and are least concerned with bequests. We elicited risk and time preferences, and found an average
RRA parameter between 1\.74 to 2\.48 for pre\-retirees and 2\.48 to 3\.74 for retirees, and a median subjective time
discount factor of 0\.997\. A study of decision\-making under risky scenarios reveals dramatic differences between
164the actual and implied choices under the expected utility maximization framework. Particularly, in the presence
of inflation risk, agents lack the understanding of the long\-term cumulative impact of inflation on the cost of
living. In the presence of investment risk, the upside gain drives decision\-making, and the presence of minimum
income protection effectively provided by public pension income induces more risk\-taking behaviour. The last
chapter concludes the thesis, and proposes general directions for future work in retirement planning research.

The article describes an approach to asset\-liability modeling using discrete time stochastic linear programming.
The model uses future scenarios and optimizes the asset\-liability mix subject to various constraints and is
applicable to insurance companies, bank trading departments, overall bank asset\-liability management, and
other financial institutions. An application to the Siemens Austria pension fund, where the model has been
in use since 2000, is described. The model has had considerable success and has been used by regulators to
determine the effect of various possible pension fund policy changes. It has also been used by pension fund
advisors who deal with uncertain assets and liabilities subject to various legal and policy constraints.

Recordkeepers are bolstering education, projection modeling tools and tailored advice capabilities to support
plan participants and encourage them to remain on track for retirement income planning.
Plan sponsors and advisers are preparing for defined contribution (DC) plan participants’ reactions to the
lifetime income estimates that will be coming on their plan statements this year with custom tools and planning
advice, as well as investment menu evaluations.
In 2019’s Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act, Congress required that
DC plans provide retirement plan participants with projections illustrating monthly retirement income amounts
generated from their accumulated retirement savings. The Department of Labor (DOL)’s interim final rule on
the matter, published in September, requires that participants’ projected income be illustrated as an account
balance conversion to a lifetime income annuity.
